The University of California, the Federal Weapons Labs, and the Founding of the Atomic West

Gregg Herken

T hose interested in building and testing bombs have always found in the West the same allure that once drew the pioneer and now at tracts the tourist, for sparse population and wide-open spaces are condu cive to secrecy as well as to solitude.¹ Although the Manhattan Project initially considered remote places in eastern states like South Carolina and Virginia for a secret site to build the atomic bomb, ultimately both of the government's nuclear weapon design laboratories would find their home in the West.2

The choice of a western site for the first nuclear weapons laboratory was somewhat serendipitous, the decision owing not a little to the fact that three of those whom Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves consulted about the location Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Orlando Law rence, and Edwin McMillan-were physicists at the University of Califor nia.3 According to legend, Oppenheimer was instrumental in picking Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the site for the first atomic lab. Not only did this location allow him to combine his two loves-physics and the desert but both he and his brother Frank had fond memories of summers spent nearby at the ranch they called "Perro Caliente '' ("Hot Dog").

Yet, if geography and convenience made the West the obvious choice, these attributes do not explain why this relationship not only continued after the war but grew and flourished-when isolation and solitude were no longer prerequisites for designing nuclear weapons. For that, one must look to another motive, also long associated with the West: the dream of the Empire.

While Groves and Oppenheimer played key roles in the choice of Los Alamos for wartime atomic research, it was Oppenheimer's University of

California colleague-Lawrence-who deserves credit for sustaining and nurturing the tie that bound the West to nuclear weapons and the federal government: first by persuading the university to continue its stewardship of Los Alamos after the war; and, later, by his efforts to establish under the university's auspices a second weapons laboratory at Livermore, California, which now also bears his name. Lawrence's success in building an empire is all the more impressive for having been carried out by a professor at a public university.

The inventor of the cyclotron, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1939, Lawrence was no less famous among colleagues for his unparalleled skills as an entrepreneur and promoter of "big science. "5 Born in South Dakota, he abandoned a prestigious teaching post at Yale University in favor of greater opportunity out west. As the chairman of Berkeley's physics department never failed to point out, Lawrence was the rara avis among scientists-a Nobel laureate from a state-supported university.

In the Radiation Laboratory, Lawrence by the outbreak of war had built a scientific mecca on the hill above the Berkeley campus. Characteristically operating behind the scenes rather than in the limelight-a personal trait that well predated wartime secrecy-Lawrence played a major role in mobilizing scientific brain power for the Manhattan Project. Most notably, the "Calutrons" of Lawrence's design were used to separate the uranium for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.

By war's end, he was launched upon the creation of an even more grandiose "paradise of physics" under his personal direction. With a degree of success that probably even he found surprising, Lawrence would accomplish that goal-first by salvaging the tie between weapons work and the West at the conclusion of the war, and then by making that bond enduring in the wary peace that followed.

That the University of California would be chosen to steward the military atom from the Manhattan Project to the end of the Cold War was far from obvious at the time of Japan's surrender. As scientific director of wartime Los Alamos, Oppenheimer had continually chafed at the bureaucratic restrictions imposed by the university, which administered the lab on behalf of the Army. In order to circumvent delays and avoid endless questions from prying UC administrators, Oppenheimer successfully kept the purpose of the Los Alamos project a secret even from the regents' secretary-treasurer, Robert Underhill, who was responsible for overseeing the Army contract. (It was Lawrence who later let Underhill in on the secret.)

The relationship between the University of California and the Army was, to be sure, one that both patron and client often found frustrating. Groves, for his part, complained that Los Alamos held the record for the greatest number of prima donnas ever assembled in one place. As early as March 1944, more than a year before the first bomb was ready to test, the university's president, Robert Gordon Sproul, instructed Oppen heimer and Underhill to begin planning for a "tapering off" of the institution's involvement with Los Alamos.10

Its wartime arrangement with the university evidently seemed an unnatural alliance to the Army, too. On August 20, 1945-less than a week after the Japanese surrender-Groves's aide, Colonel Kenneth Nichols, confirmed to Underhill that the Army and the University of California would sever their ties by the beginning March 1946.11 President Sproul was likewise eager upon the cessation of hostilities to liquidate this wartime partnership, and to "get rid of bomb making, plutonium, and New Mexico," he told the regents. 12

Nonetheless, by early 1946, when efforts to create a mostly civilian successor to the Army's Manhattan Project bogged down in Congress, even Groves had begun to drag his feet in fleeing the groves of academe. Memories of Lawrence's skills at organizing scientists probably contributed to the general's change of heart. Sproul, too, had evidently begun to have second thoughts. At the very meeting where the university's president vowed to rid himself of Los Alamos, he had also professed a desire to keep Lawrence "close to atomic energy." Facing stiff competition from the University of Chicago in what promised to be the lucrative arena of postwar atomic energy research, Sproul had assured Lawrence during a September 1945 meeting in the president's office that he was "unwilling to yield this field, in which we are now preeminent, to any other institution.''13

Sproul's motivation for a postwar alliance with the Army went beyond mere regional pride or academic parochialism. As Lawrence was no doubt quick to point out, the new field of atomic energy seemed an area not only ripe for new discoveries but full of opportunities for the institutions that sponsored the research. While the financial aspect was probably not a major inducement for extending the relationship, Underhill, for one,

GREGG HERKEN

was aware that the university's charge for overhead meant that not only glory, but money, would continue to flow from such an alliance.¹4

Lawrence himself was undoubtedly the most eager to foster a tie that permanently bound the university and the Army in the matter of the atom. Before the war, he had found it necessary to turn to private philanthropies like the Rockefeller Foundation to fund the cyclotrons that were ever growing in size and expense, basing his appeal on speculative hopes that, in addition to treating diseases like leukemia, the radioisotopes produced by the machines might even, one day, cure cancer. 15 Now, in the afterglow of victory, the prospect of a never-ending struggle for private grants was supplanted by the vision of an inexhaustible cornucopia of government funding, readily at hand.

Within weeks of the war's end, Lawrence had submitted to Groves a detailed plan for federal support of a burgeoning postwar Rad Lab. 16 During subsequent months, Lawrence and members of his Rad Lab urged Underhill and Sproul to postpone termination of the contract with the Army to run Los Alamos. ¹7

The potential connection between the Army's continuing dependence on the university and his own ambitious plans for the future Rad Lab certainly did not escape Lawrence. When Oppenheimer threatened to leave Berkeley and CalTech, Lawrence cited "Oppie's" close ties to Groves and government funding as a reason Sproul should try to persuade the temperamental physicist to stay. "How much we pay Professor Oppen heimer really means nothing because the Government will place such large sums at our disposal if Oppenheimer is here, that his salary will be

insignificant," Lawrence told Sproul. (The latter demurred, however, that "this should not be the basis of our arrangements with Oppenheimer.") 18 At an April 1946 meeting which Sproul, according to his office diary,

Originally intended to be a roundup and showdown on the New Mexico project,the president not only again delayed ending the contract for Los Alamos but approved new Army funding for Lawrence's lab. A week later, Sproul extended the University's contract to administer Los Alamos for another four months.19

Ultimately, Lawrence's legendary persuasiveness succeeded in changing the minds of the university's president, its head regent, and the regents' treasurer concerning the wisdom of continuing the wartime partnership with the government. In return, Lawrence received a virtually guaranteed source of continued funding for his burgeoning empire of the atom on the West Coast.

Partly in recognition of Lawrence's role in maintaining the link be tween the bomb and the University of California, in January 1947 the newly created Atomic Energy Commission agreed that it would regard the installation on the slopes of UC's Charter Hill as "somewhat of a national lab."20 Following a six-day meeting of the AEC at the exclusive Bohemian Grove that August-a gathering arranged by Lawrence and underwritten by his friend and benefactor, Alfred Loomis-the director of the Commission's Research Division, James Fisk, reversed an earlier decision and cleared the way for government funding of a new kind of particle accelerator at the Rad Lab.21

Before his rivals at the University of Chicago or Columbia University could rally their forces, Lawrence had pulled off a fait accompli, assuring for the University of California a dominant position in federally funded postwar atomic research. In the face of Lawrence's persistent and skillful lobbying, even the AEC's own General Advisory Committee (GAC) proved unable, or unwilling, to break what one of its members, Colum bia physicist I. I. Rabi, would come to call-with perhaps equal measures of envy and rue-the "University of California atomic trust."22

At Los Alamos itself, meanwhile, Oppenheimer's successor-Stanford University physicist Norris Bradbury-although appointed by Groves rather than by the university, soon made peace with Sproul and Under hill, and learned to exploit the fact that neither his masters in Washington nor those in California were close enough to check up on the daily operations of the laboratory.23 Lawrence, too, discovered that there were benefits to having an absentee landlord, and similarly took advantage of his lab's geographic separation from Washington.24

At a climactic meeting between Sproul and the AEC on January 9, 1948, Lawrence persuaded the president to finally cement the univer sity's relationship with the AEC by agreement on separate and renewable contracts, under which the university would continue to administer Los Alamos and the AEC would continue to fund research at the Rad Lab. Not coincidentally, AEC General Manager Carroll Wilson also promised Sproul at this meeting that Lawrence, as the university's representative for Los Alamos, would have "a free run of the place."25

After January 1948, neither the university's president nor the AEC'S

GREGG HERKEN

The general manager was any longer under the illusion that the bond between them was tenuous or temporary. Wrote Sproul in his office diary of the meeting on January 9: "My final word was 'We are now engaged, but the banns are not to be published, until each party has had an opportunity to investigate the background and intentions of the other more thoroughly." "26

Sproul's disclaimer notwithstanding, it was still, for both sides, a union of convenience. For the government, the university connection allowed Los Alamos to attract and hold talented scholars who might otherwise have balked at working for the military directly. In return, the lab's scientists received top-notch facilities, and the university a guarantee of additional funding through the yearly management fee charged to the AEC.

The seemingly unlikely marriage of the University of California and the Atomic Energy Commission was consummated shortly thereafter with the regents' approval of two renewable agreements: Contract 36, for the administration of Los Alamos, and Contract 48, for AEC-related work at Lawrence's Rad Lab.27

Although Lawrence would continue to be at the center of the relationship between the university and the AEC, another increasingly important role in the postwar years was played by San Francisco attorney John Neylan, chairman of the board of regents and also of the regents' Special Committee on the Los Alamos Project. Wealthy, conservative, and well connected in California politics, Neylan-who counted William Randolph Hearst among his legal clients-was, like Lawrence, a transplant from the East who had come West to better his prospects. Neylan be came both a social mentor and unofficial political adviser to Lawrence.28

Just as Sproul was endeavoring to untangle the university from Los Alamos, Neylan in August 1945 had created the Special Committee, a move whose effect would perpetuate the tie binding the university to the government and the atom.29 Evidently overcoming his own earlier doubts about such a marriage, Neylan appears to have been motivated by his personal friendship with, and unwavering faith in, Ernest Law rence, as well as by the vision he and Lawrence shared of an expanding laboratory funded with federal money.30

If the union of a public university and a secret laboratory was unusual, then Neylan's Special Committee, charged with responsibility for overseeing the running of Los Alamos, was surely unique. From the outset, Neylan and the three other members of the committee--Sproul and Regents Harrison and Rowell-agreed to accept the AEC's assurance that the requests it forwarded to them for approval, although shrouded in secrecy and sometimes obscured by technical esoterica, were made in good faith and in the nation's best interests. As a result, those who served on the Special Committee routinely, and deliberately, operated in a state of ignorance concerning the substance of the AEC business they were asked to sanction on behalf of the university.

While Neylan and the Special Committee were given "Q" clearances by the AEC, it is evident from the minutes of their meetings that the committee's members did not feel they had the technical competence or, perhaps, the right-to question the AEC's actions during the height of the Cold War.31 Instead, they chose to defer to those whose opinion they trusted most. As Neylan later acknowledged to Lawrence and Brad bury: "As you gentlemen know, the Committee, with full knowledge of the Regents, has at all times relied very heavily on your judgment. ... In fact, there has been little else they could do."32

Under these circumstances, when the Special Committee received, in mid-December 1951, an "exceedingly urgent" but typically vague AEC request "for special equipment and material necessary in connection with the primary purposes of Project 36," its members agreed-without substantial debate, or even much discussion-to administer three sub contracts on behalf of the AEC, totaling $11 million. By this seemingly innocuous act, the president and regents of the University of California unanimously and evidently unknowingly-approved funding for the construction of the world's first hydrogen bomb. Eleven months later, the device was successfully tested in the Pacific.33

Just as Oppenheimer established the tie between the West and the bomb, and Lawrence cemented and defended that relationship, a third University of California physicist-Edward Teller-deserves credit for providing the impetus that would extend the UC-AEC bond to include establishment of a second weapons lab.

A figure from the dawn of the atomic age, Teller subsequently boasted that he entered the drama as a chauffeur, driving Leo Szilard to Ein stein's house on Long Island. in 1939, where the two men wrote the fateful letter to Roosevelt that eventually resulted in the Manhattan

GREGG HERKEN

Project.34 A decade later, Teller was a committed advocate of proceeding with the next, more powerful generation of nuclear explosives-the "super" (hydrogen) bomb, which was then under development at Los Alamos.

Teller's argument that competition would mean more rapid progress toward a hydrogen bomb proved irresistible in the political climate of the time. The case for the second lab made by Teller and other members of the so-called H-bomb lobby-a politically conservative coalition of forces which included the Air Force, the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE), AEC Commissioner Lewis Strauss, and Ernest Lawrence-thus eventually overrode opposition from the director of Los Alamos, the GAC, and a majority of AEC Commissioners, 35

In a compromise worked out between advocates of the superbomb, the AEC, and the university regents in June 1952, it was agreed that, in addition to helping Los Alamos with "diagnostic and measurement work" on the H-bomb, Lawrence's Rad Lab would "eventually suggest broader programs of thermonuclear research to be carried out by the U.C.R.L. or elsewhere." Three weeks later, on July 1, the regents of the University of California approved the creation of the second weapons lab "with the advice of E. O. Lawrence."36

Although Teller provided the final impetus, it was the organizing skill and reputation of Lawrence that made the second lab possible. The previous February, Lawrence and Teller together had picked Livermore where the Rad Lab was building a mammoth new accelerator-as the site for the second lab.37

Despite the creation of the Livermore laboratory under conditions of near-wartime urgency, America's first hydrogen bomb was in fact de signed by scientists at Los Alamos. As outlined in the AEC's June 1952 letter to the regents, Livermore's sole contribution to the "Mike'' test the following November was a series of diagnostic experiments that would confirm the prototype weapon's success.

However, misleading popular accounts of the development of the superbomb-abetted by allies of the H-bomb lobby-mistakenly as signed to Livermore the credit that should have gone to Los Alamos.38 Neither public protests from the director and staff of Los Alamos, nor subsequent disclaimers by Teller and Lawrence, were able to defuse the animosity between scientists at the two labs. 39 Moreover, adding a bitter personal dimension to this feud was the fact that Teller and Lawrence were known to have sided with those in the AEC and JCAE who, in the spring of 1954, provoked a security investigation of Oppenheimer on the charge of disloyalty.

In spectacular Wild West fashion, the rivalry between Los Alamos and Livermore was played out in the tests of competing weapons prototypes at proving grounds in Nevada and the Pacific during the early to mid 1950s.40⁰ Abiding by its unwritten charter that it would not duplicate work being done at Los Alamos, Livermore agreed early on to tackle novel approaches to weapons design, and to explore avenues that had been tried previously but abandoned as unpromising by Los Alamos.¹¹

The first two fission bombs designed at Livermore utilized just such an unorthodox approach; it was one that, not coincidentally, had been favored by Teller at wartime Los Alamos and afterward. Since both bombs were highly experimental, the failure of the Nevada "Ruth" and "Ray" tests to produce satisfactory results in the spring of 1953 was not entirely unexpected. 12 However, the fact that the bomb tested in "Ruth" failed to demolish even the tower on which it stood provoked merri ment among Los Alamos weaponeers-one of whom reportedly ob served, sotto voce, that in future tests Livermore should use either a bigger bomb or a smaller tower. 43

A year later, the first Livermore-designed fusion bombs-devices code-named "Morgenstern" and "Ramrod"-yielded similarly disap pointing results in the Pacific. In the "Koon'' test, the thermonuclear component of the Morgenstern device failed to ignite, producing an explosion only a fraction of the million-ton force expected.44 Reluctantly, but wisely, embarrassed Livermore scientists decided not to proceed with the test of Ramrod, which was similar to Morgenstern in design. 45

By the spring of 1955, however, the tide had begun to turn for the second lab. With the explosion that March of two Livermore-designed fission devices in Nevada tests code-named "Turk" and "Tesla," the lab that Lawrence and Teller built finally achieved its first successes in the weapons field.46 Two tests-code-named "Zuni" and "Tewa"-of H bomb prototypes the following year in the Pacific proved that Livermore was now able to build multimegaton hydrogen bombs as well.47 Within weeks of the successful Tewa test, in fact, Teller was sufficiently confi dent of the lab's ability to promise the Navy that Livermore would

deliver within five years a one-megaton warhead small enough to fit on a submarine-launched ballistic missile-a feat reportedly dismissed as impossible by some Los Alamos scientists.18

The successful test of the W-47 Polaris warhead, in the July 1958 "Hard tack" series, marked the true coming-of-age of the Livermore lab putting it on a par with, or even slightly ahead of, Los Alamos. But ironically Livermore's long-delayed respectability as a nuclear lab occurred just as both labs were confronting the prospect of fundamental change. Only a month after Livermore's triumph with Polaris, the lab's patron, Law rence, was dead of ulcerative colitis. Lawrence had been stricken while representing the AEC in negotiations at Geneva aimed at bringing an end to nuclear testing. Barely a fortnight after his death, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a moratorium on nuclear tests.

Even before the moratorium began in the fall of 1958, realization was dawning at the labs that the "boom" brought about by federal support might some day go "bust." The possibility that both nuclear weapons and nuclear testing might be entering a rococo phase had occurred to Los Alamos director Bradbury as early as the fall of 1955. In a response to an AEC inquiry about long-range planning at Los Alamos, Bradbury observed that the future looked "somewhat unrewarding.''49 In terms of technical challenges, there no longer appeared "to be any un-scaled peak on the horizon," he mused. The time seemed to be approach ing when "[e]veryone will ultimately have all the weapons in all the variety wanted," in which case the bomb itself might "gradually cease to have a dominant role in international relations." He concluded, somewhat plaintively: "In short, what should Los Alamos then be in a position to do?"

Increasingly, public concern with the fallout from nuclear testing spurred by the accidental irradiation of a Japanese fishing boat in the March 1954 "Bravo" test, and manifested during the 1956 presidential campaign by support for pro-ban candidate Adlai Stevenson-also cast a pall of uncertainty over the future of the labs.so

Despite an imaginative holding action in the spring of 1957, when Teller, Lawrence, and a third Livermore colleague briefly persuaded the Eisenhower administration of the potential merits to be found in a virtu ally fallout-free "clean" bomb, the moratorium ultimately overwhelmed test-ban opponents with the force of an idea whose time had come. Indeed, Lawrence's role as a putative arms controller at Geneva that summer suggests that even he had by then lost some of the faith of his original conviction that the country needed bigger and better bombs.52

The prospect of a permanent end to nuclear testing, implicit in the moratorium, provoked not only anxiety but also a change in focus at the weapons labs. At Los Alamos, work was initiated on an atomic-powered rocket aimed at carrying American astronauts to Mars, and possibly beyond. At Livermore, development began on a nuclear-powered ramjet the precursor of today's cruise missile--which would carry to targets in Russia the bombs that the lab was no longer able to test in Nevada and the Pacific.53

Perhaps because of the test moratorium, Bradbury was more pessimistic than ever about the future of Los Alamos in a September 1959 letter to the ABC. The following year, Teller resigned as director of Livermore, in part so that he might more effectively lobby for a resumption of nuclear testing and promote an anti missile defense for the country.54

As events developed, Bradbury and Teller need not have worried that a temporary end to nuclear testing was the harbinger of a permanent peace. The sudden, unexpected resumption of Soviet nuclear testing in September 1961, and the consequent revival and acceleration of both the arms race and the Cold War, removed for the next thirty years the danger that the weapons labs would have nothing left to do.

During that time, Los Alamos and Livermore produced new weapons, including the so-called neutron bomb, as well as further refinements of old ones like the miniaturized warheads which made possible MIRVed missiles and in turn led to the almost explosive growth of nuclear weap ons in the U.S. stockpile. In what was perhaps the culmination of this trend, the advent of directed-energy weapons such as the nuclear bomb pumped X-ray laser, invented at Livermore, opened the doors in the early 1980s both to a new "third generation" of nuclear weaponry and to the Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars").55

The end of the Cold War would raise anew the question that worried the director of Los Alamos in 1955, and then came to haunt both labs three years later, during the moratorium: What are the weapons labs to do when nuclear weapons have ceased to have a dominant role in international relations?

Beginning in the early 1970s, and repeatedly since then, faculty and students at the University of California, disaffected with that institution's role as overseer of the nuclear labs, have actively lobbied the university to sever its ties with Los Alamos and Livermore. In a sign emblematic of this change in outlook, Ernest Lawrence's widow, Molly, petitioned Congress to have her husband's name removed from the Livermore lab,56

For the university itself, neither patriotic appeal nor the financial incentive of the annual management fee has succeeded in dispelling the growing belief that what was once an asset has become a liability,57 Meanwhile, for the first time in its own history, even the Department of Energy, the AEC's successor, is reportedly willing to entertain the possibility that there may no longer be a case for maintaining two nuclear design labs. 58

In the absence of a strong advocate like Lawrence or a convincing reason-for-being based on national security, the sun has seemingly been gun to set on the dream of the Empire that first gave rise to the Atomic West. Indeed, the laboratory that Lawrence and Teller built has had its foundations undermined by the end of the conflict that originally nurtured and sustained it.

For both sides, the wisdom of maintaining the bond, now more than half a century old, between the federal atomic energy establishment and the University of California is being seriously questioned anew. In a world fundamentally different from the one that saw it come into being, the marriage between the weapons labs and the West is under increasing strain; the two partners have grown distant and quarrelsome, and there is talk of separation.

Students for a Democratic Society

1. "The Port Huron Statement"

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was founded in June 1960 at a New York convention sponsored by the League for Industrial Democracy. But at the 1962 SDS convention at Port Huron, Michigan, SDS's differences with the League became manifest. "The Port Huron Statement" established the basic guidelines for SDS, in ideology and action.

In "The Port Huron Statement," which bears the stamp of a single author (Tom Hayden), there is criticism of both the pathological anti-Communism which characterizes American politics and Communism itself. "The Port Huron Statement '' has a special relevance for middle-class intellectuals and college students; It is not a "Communist Manifesto," outlining programs for revolution, but rather a general, broad critique, suggesting guidelines for a radical politics. It is not aimed at a working-class constituency, nor does it depend upon a program for the working class, or for any class. A similar paper today would emphasize build

Ing an "Independent power base" among the poor. The 1962 SDS statement relles on working with and through "liberal" Institutions, the ADA, the labor movement, political parties. A great deal of time is spent on Congressional reform, for example. It shows a faith in the student civil rights movement as the engine of change to build a coalition of liberal-labor civil rights forces.

INTRODUCTION: AGENDA FOR A GENERATION

We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably at the world we inherit.

When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations that we thought would distribute Western influ ence throughout the world. Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people-these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.

As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we our selves, and our friends, and millions of abstract "others" we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. We might deliberately ignore, or avoid, or fail to feel all other human problems, but not these two, for these were too immediate and crushing in their impact, too challenging in the demand that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution.

While these and other problems either directly oppressed us or ranked our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration "all men are created equal. . ." rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.

We witnessed, and continue to witness, other paradoxes. With nuclear energy whole cities can easily be powered, yet the dominant nation-states seem more likely to unleash destruction greater than that incurred in all wars of human history. Although our own technology is destroying old and creating new forms of social organization, men still tolerate meaningless work and idleness. While two-thirds of mankind suffers undernourishment, our own upper classes revel amidst superfluous abundance. Although world population is expected to double in forly years, the nations still tolerate anarchy as a major principle of international conduct and uncontrolled exploitation governs the sapping of the earth's physical resources. Although mankind desperately needs revolutionary leadership, America rests in national stalemate, its goals ambiguous and tradition-bound instead of informed and clear, ita democratic system apathetic and manipulated rather than "of, by, and for the people."

Not only did tarnish appear on our Image of American virtue, not only did disillusion occur when the hypocrisy of American Ideals was discovered, but we began to sense that what we had originally seen as the American Golden Age was actually the decline of an era. The worldwide outbreak of revolution against colonialism and imperialism, the entrenchment of totalitarian states, the menace of war, overpopulation, international dis order, super technology-these trends were testing the tenacity of our own commitment to democracy and freedom and our abilities to visualize their application to a world in upheaval.

Our work is guided by the sense that we may be the last generation in the experiment with living. But we are a minority. The vast majority of our people regard the temporary equilibriums of our society and world as eternally functional parts. This is perhaps the outstanding paradox: we ourselves are imbued with urgency, yet the message of our society is that there is no viable alternative to the present. Beneath the reassuring tones of the politicians, beneath the common opinion that AmerIca will "muddle through," beneath the stagnation of those who have closed their minds to the future, is the pervading feeling that there simply are no alternatives, that our times have witnessed the exhaustion not only of Utopias, but of any new departures as well. Feeling the press of complexity upon the emptiness of life, people are fearful of the thought that at any moment things might be thrust out of control. They fear change Itself, since change might smash whatever invisible framework seems to hold back chaos for them now. For most Americans, all crusades are suspect, threatening. The fact that each individual sees apathy in his fellows perpetuates the common reluctance to organize for change. The dominant institutions are complex enough to blunt the minds of their potential critics, and entrenched enough to swiftly dissipate or entirely repel the energies of protest and reform, thus limiting human expectancies. Then, too, we are a materially improved society, and by our own improvements we seem to have weakened the case for further change.

Some would have us believe that Americans feel contentment amidst prosperity-but might it not better be called a glaze above deeply felt anxieties about their role in the new world? And if these anxieties produce a developed indifference to human affairs, do they not as well produce a yearning to believe there is an alternative to the present, that something can be done to change circumstances in the school, the workplaces, the bureaucracies, the government? It is to this latter yearning, at once the spark and engine of change, that we direct our present appeal. The search for truly democratic alternatives to the present, and a commitment to social experimentation with them, is a worthy and fulfilling human enterprise, one which moves us and, we hope, others today. On such a basis do we offer this document of our convictions and analysis: as an effort in understanding and changing the conditions of humanity in the late twentieth century, an effort rooted in the ancient, still unfulfilled conception of man attaining determining Influence over his circumstances of life.

VALUES

Making values explicit-an initial task in establishing alternatives is an activity that has been devalued and corrupted. The conventional moral terms of the age, the politician moralities ``free world,``''people's democracies' '-reflect realities poorly, if at all, and seem to function more as ruling myths than as descriptive principles. But neither has our experience in the ual versities brought us moral enlightenment. Our professors and administrators sacrifice controversy to public relations; their curriculums change more slowly than the living events of the world; their skills and silence are purchased by investors in the arms race; passion is called scholastic. The questions we might want raised-what is really important? Can we live in a different and better way? If we wanted to change society, how would we do it?-are not thought to be questions of a "fruitful, empirical nature," and thus are brushed aside.

Unlike youth in other countries we are used to moral leadership being exercised and moral dimensions being clarified by our. elders. But today, for us, not even the liberal and socialist preachments of the past seem adequate to the forms of the present. Consider the old slogans: Capitalism Cannot Reform Itself, United Front Against Fascism, General Strike, All Out on May Day. Or, more recently, No Cooperation with Comics and Fellow Travelers, Ideologies are Exhausted, Bipartisanship, No Utopias. These are incomplete, and there are few new prophets. It has been said that our liberal and socialist predecessors were plagued by vision without program, while our own generation is plagued by program without vision. All around us there is astute grasp of method, technique-the committee, the ad hoc group, the lobbyist, the hard and soft sell, the make, the projected im age-but, if pressed critically, such expertise is incompetent to explain its implicit ideals. It is highly fashionable to identify oneself by old categories, or by naming a respected political figure, or by explaining "how we would vote '' on various issues.

Theoretic chaos has replaced the idealistic thinking of old and, unable to reconstitute theoretic order, men have condemned idealism itself. Doubt has replaced hopefulness-and mea act out a defeatism that is labeled realistic. The decline of utopia and hope is in fact one of the defining features of social life today. The reasons are various: the dreams of the older left were perverted by Stalinism and never recreated; the con gressional stalemate makes men narrow their view of the pos sible; the specialization of human activity leaves little room for sweeping thought; the horrors of the twentieth century, symbol ized in the gas ovens and concentration camps and atom bombs, have blasted hopefulness. To be idealistic is to be considered apocalyptic, deluded. To have no serious aspirations, on the contrary, is to be "tough-minded."

In suggesting social goals and values, therefore, we are aware of entering a sphere of some disrepute. Perhaps matured by the past, we have no sure formulas, no closed theories: but that does not mean values are beyond discussion and tentative determination. The first task of any social movement is to convince people that the search for orienting theories and the creation of human values is complex but worthwhile. We are aware that to avoid platitudes we must analyze the concrete conditions of social order. But to direct such an analysis we must use the guide posts of basic principles. Our own social values involve conceptions of human beings, human relationships, and social systems.

We regard men as infinitely precious and possessed of unfulfilled capacities for reason, freedom, and love. In affirming these principles we are aware of countering perhaps the dominant conceptions of man in the twentieth century: that he is a thing to be manipulated, and that he is inherently incapable of directing his own affairs. We oppose the depersonalization that reduces human beings to the status of things-If anything, the brutalities of the twentieth century teach that means and ends are intimately related, that vague appeals to "posterity'' cannot justify the mutilations of the present. We oppose, too, the doctrine of human incompetence because it rests essentially on the modern fact that men have been "competently" manipulated into Incom pelence-we see little reason why men cannot meet with in creasing skill the complexities and responsibilities of their situ ation, if society is organized not for minority, but for majority, participation in decision-making.

Men have unrealized potential for self-cultivation, self direction, self-understanding, and creativity. It is this potential that we regard as crucial and to which we appeal, not to the human potential for violence, unreason, and submission to authority. The goal of man and society should be human independence: a concern not with image of popularity but with finding a meaning in life that is personally authentic; a quality of mind not compulsively driven by a sense of powerlessness, nor one which unthinkingly adopts status values, nor one which re presses all threats to its habits, but one which has full, spontaneous access to present and past experiences, ons which easily unites the fragmented parts of personal history, one which openly faces problems which are troubling and unresolved; one with an intuitive awareness of possibilities, an active sense of curiosity, an ability and willingness to learn.

This kind of independence does not mean egotastic individualism-the object is not to have one's way so much as it is to have a way that is one's own. Nor do we deify man-we merely have faith in his potential.

Human relationships should involve fraternity and honesty. Human Interdependence is a contemporary fact; human brother bood must be willed, however, as a condition of future survival and as the most appropriate form of social relations. Personal links between man and man are needed, especially to go beyond the partial and fragmentary bonds of function that bind men only as worker to worker, employer to employee, teacher to student, American to Russian.

Loneliness, estrangement, Isolation describe the vast distance between man and man today. These dominant tendencies cannot be overcome by better personnel management, nor by improved gadgets, but only when a love of man overcomes the idolatrous worship of things by man. As the individualism we affirm is not egoism, the selflessness we affirm is not self-elimination. On the contrary, we believe in generosity of a kind that imprints one's unique individual qualities in the relation to other men, and to all human activity. Further, to dislike isolation is not to favor the abolition of privacy; the latter differs from isolation in that it occurs or is abolished according to individual will.

We would replace power rooted in possession, privilege, or circumstance by power and uniqueness rooted in love, reflectiveness, reason, and creativity. As a social system we seek the establishment of a democracy of individual participation, governed by two central aims: that the individual shares in those social decisions determining the quality and direction of his life; that society be organized to encourage Independence in men and provide the media for their common participation.

In a participatory democracy, the political life would be based in several root principles:

that decision-making of basic social consequence be carried on by public groupings; that politics be seen positively, as the art of collectively creating an acceptable pattern of social relations; that politics has the function of bringing people out of isolation and into community, thus being a necessary, though not sufficient, means of finding meaning in personal life;

that the political order should serve to clarify problems in a way instrumental to their solution; it should provide outlets for the expression of personal grievance and aspiration; opposing views should be organized so as to illuminate choices and facilitate the attainment of goals; channels should be commonly available to relate men to knowledge and to power so that private problems-from bad recreation facilities to personal alienation-are formulated as general issues.

The economic sphere would have as its basis the principles: that work should involve incentives worthier than money or survival. It should be educative, not stultifying; creative, not mechanical; self-directed, not manipulated, encouraging independence, a respect for others, a sense of dignity and a willingness to accept social responsibility, since it is this experience that has crucial influence on habits, perceptions and individual ethics;

that the economic experience is so personally decisive that the individual must share in its full determination;

that the economy itself is of such social importance that its major resources and means of production should be open to democratic participation and subject to democratic social regulation.

Like the political and economic ones, major social institutions -cultural, educational, rehabilitative, and others-should be generally organized with the well-being and dignity of man as the essential measure of success.

In social change or interchange, we find violence to be abhorrent because it generally requires the transformation of the target, be it a human being or a community of people, into a depersonalized object of hate. It is imperative that the means of violence be abolished and the institutions-local, national, inter-national-that encourage nonviolence as a condition of conflict be developed.

These are our central values, in skeletal form. It remains vital to understand their denial or attainment in the context of the modern world.

THE STUDENTS

In the last few years, thousands of American students demonstrated that they at least felt the urgency of the times. They moved actively and directly against racial injustices, the threat of war, violations of individual rights of conscience and, less frequently, against economic manipulation. They succeeded in restoring a small measure of controversy to the campusca after the stillness of the McCarthy period. They succeeded, too, in gaining some concessions from the people and institutions they opposed, especially in the fight against racial bigotry.

The significance of these scattered movements lics not in their success or failure in gaining objectives at least not yet. Nor does the significance lie in the intellectual "competence" or "ina turity" of the students involved-as some pedantic elders allege. The significance is in the fact the students are breaking the crust of apathy and overcoming the inner alienation that remain the defining characteristics of American college life.

If student movements for change are still rarities on the campus scene, what is commonplace there? The real campus, the familiar campus, is a place of private people, engaged in their notorious "inner emigration." It is a place of commitment to business-as-usual, getting ahead, playing it cool. It is a place of mass affirmation of the Twist, but mass reluctance toward the controversial public stance. Rules are accepted as "inevitable," bureaucracy as "just circumstances," irrelevance as "scholarship," selflessness as "martyrdom," politics as "just another way to make people, and an unprofitable one, too."

Almost no students value activity as citizens. Passive in public, they are hardly more idealistic in arranging their private lives: Gallup concludes they will settle for "low success, and won't risk high failure." There is not much willingness to take risks (not even in business), no setting of dangerous goals, no real conception of personal identity except one manufactured in the image of others, no real urge for personal fulfillment except to be almost as successful as the very successful people. Attention is being paid to social status (the quality of shirt collars, meeting people, getting wives or husbands, making solid contacts for later on); much, too, is paid to academic status (grades, honors, the med school rat race). But neglected generally is real intellectual status, the personal cultivation of the mind.

"Students don't even give a damn about the apathy," one has said. Apathy toward apathy begets a privately constructed uni verse, a place of systematic study schedules, two nights each week for beer, a girl or two, and early marriage; a framework infused with personality, warmth, and under control, no matter how unsatisfying otherwise.

Under these conditions university life loses all relevance to some. Four hundred thousand of our classmates leave college every year.

But apathy is not simply an attitude; it is a product of social institutions, and of the structure and organization of higher education itself. The extracurricular life is ordered according to in loco parentis theory, which ratifies the administration as the moral guardian of the young.

The accompanying "let's pretend" theory of student extracurricular affairs validates student government as a training center for those who want to spend their lives in political pretense, and discourages initiative from the more articulate, honest, and sensitive students. The bounds and style of controversy are delimited before controversy begins. The university "prepares' ' the student for "citizenship" through perpetual rehearsals and, usually, through emasculation of what creative spirit there is in the individual.

The academic life contains reinforcing counterparts to the way in which extracurricular life is organized. The academic world is founded on a teacher-student relation analogous to the parent-child relation which characterizes in loco parentis. Further, academia includes a radical separation of the student from the material of study. That which is studied, the social reality, is "objectified" to sterility, dividing the student from life-Just as he is restrained in active involvement by the deans controlling student government. The specialization of function and knowledge, admittedly necessary to our complex technological and so

cial structure has produced an exaggerated compartmentalization of study and understanding. This has contributed to an overly parochial view, by faculty, of the role of its research and scholarship, to a discontinuous and truncated understanding, by students, of the surrounding social order; and to a loss of personal attachment, by nearly all, to the worth of study as a bu manistic enterprise.

There is, finally, the cumbersome academic bureaucracy extending throughout the academic as well as the extracurricular structures, contributing to the sense of outer complexity and Inner powerlessness that transforms the honest searching of many students to a ratification of convention and, worse, to a numbness to present and future catastrophes. The size and financing systems of the university enhance the permanent trusteeship of the administrative bureaucracy, their power leading to a shift within the university toward the value standards of business and the administrative mentality. Huge foundations and other private financial interests shape the under-financed colleges and universities, not only making them more commercial, but less disposed to diagnose society critically, less open to dissent. Many social and physical scientists, neglecting the liberating heritage of higher learning, develop "human relations' ' or "murale producing" techniques for the corporate economy, while others exercise their intellectual skills to accelerate the arms race....

There are no convincing apologies for the contemporary malaise. While the world tumbles toward the final war, while men in other nations are trying desperately to alter events, while the very future qua future is uncertain-America is without community, impulse, without the inner momentum necessary for an age when societies cannot successfully perpetuate themselves by their military weapons, when democracy must be viable because of the quality of life, not its quantity of rockets.

The apathy here is, first, subjective-the fell powerlessness of ordinary people, the resignation before the enormity of events. But subjective apathy is encouraged by the objective American situation: the actual structural separation of people from power, from relevant knowledge, from pinnacles of decision-making. Just as the university influences the student way of life, so do major social institutions create the circumstances in which tho Isolated citizen will try hopelessly to understand his world and himself.

The very Isolation of the individual-from power and community and ability to aspire-means the rise of a democracy without publics. With the great mass of people structurally remote and psychologically hesitant with respect to democratic institutions, those institutions themselves attenuate and become, in the fashion of the vicious circle, progressively less accessible to those few who aspire to serious participation in social affairs. The vital democratic connection between community and leadership, between the mass and the several elites, has been so wrenched and perverted that disastrous policies go unchallenged time and again.

POLITICS WITHOUT PUBLICS

The American political system is not the democratic model of which its glorifiers speak. In actuality it frustrates democracy by confusing the individual citizen, paralyzing policy discussion, and consolidating the irresponsible power of military and business interests.

A crucial feature of the political apparatus in America is that greater differences are harbored within each major party than the differences existing between them. Instead of two particles presenting distinctive and significant differences of approach, what dominates the system is a natural interlocking of Democrats from Southern states with the more conservative elements of the Republican Party. This arrangement of forces is blessed by the seniority system of Congress which guarantees Congressional committee domination by conservatives-ten of seventeen committees in the Senate and thirteen of twenty-one in the House of Representatives are chaired currently by Dixiccrats.

The party overlap, however, is not the only structural antagonist of democracy in politics. First, the localized nature of the party system does not encourage discussion of national and international issues: thus problems are not raised by and for people, and political representatives usually are unfettered from any responsibilities to the general public except those regarding parochial matters. Second, whole constituencies are divested of the full political power they might have: many Negroes in the South are prevented from voting, migrant workers are disenfranchised by various residence requirements, some urban and suburban dwellers are victimized by gerrymandering, and poor people are too often without the power to obtain political representation. Third, the focus of political attention is significantly distorted by the enormous lobby force, composed predominantly of business interests, spending hundreds of millions each year in an attempt to conform facts about productivity, agriculture, defense, and social services, to the wants of private economic groupings.

What emerges from the party contradiction and insulation of privately held power is the organized political stalemate: calcification dominates flexibility as the principle of parliamentary organization, frustration is the expectancy of legislators intending liberal reform, and Congress becomes less and less central to national decision-making, especially in the area of foreigu policy. In this context, confusion and blurring is built into the formulation of issues, long-range priorities are not discussed in the rational manner needed for policy-making, the politics of personality and "image" become a more important mechanism than the construction of issues in a way that affords each voler a challenging and real option. The American voter is buffeted from all directions by pseudo-problems, by the structurally insulated sense that nothing political is subject to human mastery. Worried by his mundane problems which never get solved, but constrained by the common belief that politics is an agonizingly slow accommodation of views, he quits all pretense of bothering.

A most alarming fact is that few, if any, politicians are calling for changes in these conditions. Only a handful even are calling on the President to "live up to" platform pledges; no one is demanding structural changes, such as the shuttling of Southern Democrats out of the Democratic Party. Rather than protesting the state of politics, most politicians are reinforcing and aggra vating that state. While in practice they rig public opinion to suit their own interests, in word and ritual they enshrine "the suVER cign public" and call for more and more letters. Their speeches and campaign actions are banal, based on a degrading conception of what people want to hear. They respond not to dialogue, but to pressure: and knowing this, the ordinary citizen sces even greater inclination to shun the political sphere. The politician is usually a trumpeter to "citizenship" and "service to the nation," but since he is unwilling to seriously rearrange power relationships, his trumpetings only increase apathy by creating no outlets. Much of the time the call to "service" Is justified not in idealistic terms, but in the crasser terms of "defending the free world from Communism''-thus making future idealistic impulses harder to justify in anything but Cold War terms.

In such a setting of status quo politics, where most if not all government activity is rationalized in Cold War anti-Communist terms, it is somewhat natural that discontented, super-patriotic groups would emerge through political channels and explain their ultra-conservatism as the best means of Victory over Com munism. They have become a politically influential force within the Republican Party, at a national level through Senator Goldwater, and at a local level through their important social and economic roles. Their political views are defined generally as the opposite of the supposed views of Communista: complete Individual freedom in the economic sphere, non-participation by the government in the machinery of production. But actually "anti Communism" becomes an umbrella by which to protest liberal ism, internationalism, welfarcism, the active civil rights and labor movements. It is to the disgrace of the United States that such a movement should become a prominent kind of public participation in the modern world-but, ironically, it is somewhat to the interests of the United States that such a movement should be a public constituency pointed toward realignment of the political parties, demanding a conservative Republican Party in the South and an exclusion of the "leftist" elements of the national GOP....
