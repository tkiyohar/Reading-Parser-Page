Global Circulation and Exchange
How have migration and the circulation of capital and technology continued to shape the world? Much of the history in this textbook is driven by the circulation of peoples over great distances. Migration continues to be one of the great engines of history, though its experience exposes one of the major contradictions in the way liberalization has been conducted: governments have pressed for the free circulation of goods and capital, but have sought to limit the movement of people across borders. Migration National immigration policies vary considerably. In Europe the process of integration has meant that European Union member countries permit the free movement of citizens from other EU nations. But in many other cases, restrictions on migration have increased even as barriers to trade and investment have fallen. The border between the United States and Mexico reflects many of the challenges of contemporary migrations. Since long before a border existed between the United States and Mexico, migrants have circulated throughout North America, but as the United States conquered land that had belonged to Mexico in the nineteenth century (see “Mexico and the United States” in Chapter 27), it restricted the movement of migrants northward across the border. At the beginning of the twenty-first century the U.S. government began building a wall at its border with Mexico, further restricting the circulation of people even as the United States and Mexico implemented a free-trade agreement that made it easier for goods and capital to cross the border. In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the border between the United States and Mexico became a symbolic flash point of anxieties over two basic elements of globalization and liberalization: the movement of peoples and the free circulation of goods and capital. Real estate developer Donald Trump rode resentments over trade and migration into the presidency in a U.S. expression of the nationalist sentiments that provoked the British vote to exit the European Union and the rise of nationalist parties in continental Europe. The patterns of migration and the votes against migration that resulted in Brexit and Trump’s election reflected the unevenness in wealth distribution both globally and within nations. Behind the politics of immigration lies a more complex reality: circuits of migration — the patterns by which peoples move between one region of the world and another — are shaped by many forces. Historical connections, such as the spaces shared by indigenous and Latino peoples on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, are one such force. A second is the intensification of trade, which reshapes national economies and the connections between them. A third is the history of U.S. military intervention: countries that are the sites of conflict spurred by or involving the United States are reshaped in ways that often create migrant and refugee circuits connected to the United States. The experience of immigration following U.S. military intervention in Central America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia forms a pattern into which future immigration from the Middle East may well fit. Since the 1960s millions of people, first from South Korea and then Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, countries that had experienced great upheavals in conflicts involving the United States, found legal refuge in the United States. (See “Individuals in Society: Sieng, a Mnong Refugee in an American High School,” page 994.) Immigrants to the United States most commonly come from regions transformed by U.S. foreign policy or economic activity; new immigrants frequently encounter discrimination, and efforts are made to restrict the entry of future immigrants. In many cases, restrictions on immigration have increased in countries where national economic growth has slowed. For instance, as Japanese industry boomed in the 1980s, the country welcomed descendants of Japanese emigrants who had settled in South America in the first half of the century. Because these migrants were culturally and linguistically different from natives, Japanese citizens considered them dekasegi, or “temporary guest workers,” who had no right to citizenship despite their ancestry.
 
Brazilians in Japan Over two hundred thousand descendants of Japanese migrants to Brazil and Peru now live in Japan as temporary workers, particularly in auto parts manufacturing. Here Brazilians of Japanese descent attend a church service in the Japanese city of Tsu. As manufacturing and economic growth stagnated in the 1990s, this circuit of migration to Japan dwindled. Though pursuit of economic opportunity and flight from persecution are the major factors that drive international migration, other factors shape the creation of migratory circuits. A migratory circuit is a deep connection created between two regions through an initial experience of migration that results in a greater circulation of people. Migrants usually become ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities in the countries where they settle, and they commonly face discrimination. Sometimes this discrimination is expressed in violence and oppression, such as that experienced by contemporary Zimbabwean workers in South Africa. In 2015 the European Union became the setting of a new migration crisis as over 1 million refugees fled armed conflicts and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. 2 The largest contingent was refugees from Syria’s civil war. The refugees faced a succession of challenges ranging from perilous crossings of the Mediterranean, in which thousands perished, to the hostility of peoples and governments, particularly in eastern Europe, where countries like Hungary had once welcomed East Germans fleeing communism but now blocked the transit of refugees. Countries began erecting fences and border controls to limit the flow of refugees, and British voters elected to exit the EU, threatening the principle of free movement that had been a pillar of the EU.
 
INDIVIDUALS IN SOCIETY
Sieng, a Mnong Refugee in an American High School Mnong students and their teaching assistant at a high school in Wisconsin recite the Pledge of Allegiance. IN 2008, AT A LARGE URBAN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE U.S. South, Sieng, a seventeen-year-old Mnong refugee, recited the Pledge of Allegiance in his JROTC class. His aspiration to join the U.S. Marine Corps was an act of belonging that bridged both his life in the United States and his sense of his family and its history. The Mnong are among a diverse group of ethnic minorities, known broadly as Montagnards, whose communities stretch across the central highlands of Vietnam. They are also a religious minority in Vietnam — many had converted to Christianity. During the Vietnam War, many Mnong provided military service alongside the United States, particularly with the U.S. Army Special Forces. After the war ended in 1975, the Mnong faced persecution, and over time many fled the country, joining the current of refugees who resettled in camps in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and later Cambodia. Sieng’s family left Vietnam when he was a child in the late 1990s. He recalled his journey: We had a hard time in Vietnam, so we had to leave. We didn’t have no choice because we had no food, and no land. And [the Vietnamese government] wanted my dad and took my grandpa. So we left in the night and went through the jungle. We walked and walked and got lost. So me and my dad tried to find the way and we found a house. Some people let us sleep there and also gave us food. Then we got to a [refugee] camp in Cambodia and stayed there for a year. I didn’t have school in Vietnam, and I didn’t have school at the camp. Then we came here. Arriving in the United States at the age of sixteen, Sieng was not literate in Mnong, Vietnamese, or English, the language of his new school. Sieng aspired to become a Marine so he could help other refugees and his family. He explained, “A man needs to take care of the family too, and that’s what I want to do. The Marines will help me take care of my family.” For Sieng, being a refugee instilled a sense of pride, a sense of what he and his family had overcome in coming to the United States, and a sense of what he desired for the future. As the oldest male child, Sieng was, in his words, “second in command” in the home while his father worked the third shift at a shipping facility. In the United States Sieng was an ethnic minority and a refugee with limited English skills. He was misunderstood. A classmate in a world history class asked him where he was from in Mexico, and the question made him indignant: I am a refugee, not an immigrant! I am Mnong, not Vietnamese! But people call me Spanish. Some kids once asked me to say something in Spanish. . . . And Mexican students think I’m Chinese. They say, “Hey Chino! Hey Chino!” I get mad when they do this because I am more like American. My grandpa worked with Americans [in the war]. In a diverse school, amid other immigrants and ethnic minorities, Sieng found comfort in his identity as a refugee, reflecting on his family’s past, its connection to the United States, and his role facilitating its journey, as he confronted a new environment, struggling to be understood. QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS 1. What aspects of Sieng’s experience reflect broader patterns of migration? 2. How does Sieng’s experience as a refugee shape his identity? 3. What role does JROTC play in Sieng’s sense of belonging? Source: Liv T. Dávila, “Performing Allegiance: An Adolescent Refugee’s Construction of Patriotism in JROTC,” Educational Studies 39.5 (2014).

Urbanization
Cities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America expanded at an astonishing pace after 1945. Many doubled or even tripled in size in a single decade (Table 33.1). In 1950 there were only eight megacities (5 million or more inhabitants), and only two were in developing countries. Of the fifty-nine megacities anticipated to exist by 2017 forty-eight will be outside North America and Europe. megacities Cities with populations of 5 million people or more. What caused this urban explosion? First, the overall population growth in the developing nations was critical. Urban residents gained substantially from a medical revolution that provided improved health care but only gradually began to reduce the size of their families. Second, more than half of all urban growth came from rural migration. Manufacturing jobs in the developing nations were concentrated in cities. In 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Even when industrial jobs have been scarce, migrants have streamed to cities, seeking any type of employment. As large landowners found it more profitable to produce export crops, their increasingly mechanized operations reduced the need for agricultural laborers. Ethnic or political unrest in the countryside can also send migrants into cities. Table 33.1 Urban Population as a Percentage of Total Population in the World and in Eight Major Areas, 1925–2025 AREA 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 (EST.) World Total 21% 28% 39% 50% 63% North America 54 64 77 86 93 Europe 48 55 67 79 88 Soviet Union 18 39 61 76 87 East Asia 10 15 30 46 63 Latin America 25 41 60 74 85 Africa 8 13 24 37 54 Note: Little more than one-fifth of the world’s population was urban in 1925. In 2000 the total urban proportion in the world was about 50 percent. According to United Nations experts, the proportion should reach two-thirds by about 2025. The most rapid urban growth will occur in Africa and Asia, where the move to cities is still in its early stages.
 
Most of the growing numbers of urban poor earned precarious livings in a bazaar economy made up of petty traders and unskilled labor. In the bazaar economy, which echoed early preindustrial markets, regular salaried jobs were rare and highly prized, and a complex world of tiny, unregulated businesses and service occupations predominated. Peddlers and pushcart operators hawked their wares, and sweatshops and homebased workers manufactured cheap goods for popular consumption. These workers typically lacked job security, unemployment insurance, and pensions. bazaar economy An economy with few salaried jobs and an abundance of tiny, unregulated businesses such as peddlers and pushcart operators. The Bazaar Economy These merchant women selling vegetables in Pisac, Peru, form part of an informal economy. After 1945 large-scale urban migration profoundly affected traditional family patterns in developing countries, just as it had during the Industrial Revolution. Particularly in Africa and Asia, the great majority of migrants to cities were young men seeking temporary or seasonal work. For rural women, the consequences of male out-migration to cities were mixed. Asian and African women found themselves heads of households, faced with added burdens in managing the farm and sustaining families. African and Asian village women became unprecedentedly self-reliant and began to assert greater rights. In Latin America migration patterns differed: whole families generally migrated, often to squatter settlements. These families frequently belonged to the class of landless laborers, which was generally larger in Latin America than in Africa and Asia. Migration was also more likely to be permanent. Another difference was that single women were as likely as single men to move to the cities, in part because women were in high demand as domestic servants. Some women also left to escape maledominated villages where they faced narrow social and economic opportunities. In cities the concentration of wealth in few hands has resulted in unequal consumption, education, and employment. The gap between rich and poor around the world can be measured both between the city and the countryside, and within cities (Map 33.1). Wealthy city dwellers in developing countries often had more in common with each other than with the poorer urban and rural people in their own country. As a result, the elites have often favored globalization that connects them with wealthier nations. Mapping the Past MAP 33.1 The Global Distribution of Wealth, ca. 2010 This size-comparison map, arranged according to global wealth distribution, vividly illustrates the gap in wealth between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The two small island nations of Japan and the United Kingdom have more wealth than all the nations of the Southern Hemisphere combined, although wealth creation in India and Brazil has advanced significantly. The wealthiest countries are also the most highly urbanized. As market capitalism expands in China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries and in Latin America and Africa, the relative-size ratios on the map will continue to change and evolve. Tiny Iceland, whose GDP is less than $20 billion, nevertheless has one of the highest per capita GDPs in the world. ANALYZING THE MAP Which three countries are the wealthiest? Where are the poorest countries concentrated? CONNECTIONS How were the two small nations of Japan and the United Kingdom able to acquire such enormous wealth? Multinational Corporations A striking feature of global interdependence beginning in the early 1950s was the rapid emergence of multinational corporations, or multinationals, which are business firms that operate in a number of different countries and tend to adopt a global rather than a national perspective. Their rise was partly due to the revival of capitalism after the Second World War, increasingly free international economic relations, and the worldwide drive for rapid industrialization. Multinationals treated the world as one big market, coordinating complex activities across political boundaries and escaping political controls and national policies. multinational corporations Business firms that operate in a number of different countries and tend to adopt a global rather than a national perspective.
 
Multinational Companies in China Shoppers at a Sam’s Club in the outskirts of Beijing reflect the globalization of consumption. Global commodity chains, multinational corporations, and converging consumer tastes, particularly among the middle class, create increasingly similar experiences across the world. The impact of multinational corporations, especially on less industrialized countries, has been mixed. The presence of multinationals helped spread the products and values of consumer society to elites in the developing world. Critics considered this part of the process of neocolonialism, whereby local elites abandoned their nation’s interests and contributed to continued foreign domination. (See “Analyzing the Evidence: A Brazilian Band on Globalization,” at right.) Multinational corporations are among the main beneficiaries of economic liberalism: growing openness of national markets and growing economic integration allow corporations to move goods, capital, and technology more fluidly and more intensely. But the growing interconnectedness of world markets comes with costs. In particular, it has meant increased economic volatility, as exemplified by the banking crisis that swept the United States and Europe in 2008 and plunged countries into deep and long recessions.

A Brazilian Band on Globalization
The rock group Mundo Livre S/A was formed in 1984 in the northeastern Brazilian city Recife, in the region first settled by the Portuguese to cultivate sugarcane with slave labor. Mundo Livre S/A, whose name translates to “Free World, Inc.,” sings about globalization from the perspective of those who live at its periphery, in poorer cities of developing countries. “Forerunners (Resisting the Global Mugging),” 2000 The computers of the mega-corporations work full time Day after day Their senior executives circulate In a world of fanaticism and devotion, Venerating the omnipresent god Naiq [Nike] Even when they should be off, They never stop researching, Investigating the streets Searching for new clues.

Social Movements
What challenges did social reformers address at the turn of the twenty-first century? Just as nineteenth-century social reformers embraced the cause of ending slavery, modern social reformers have sought to end global inequality, racism, and sexism and to expand human rights. Social movements played a critical role in the victory of the democratic movements in Latin America and Europe and the end of the apartheid system in South Africa. As movements for human rights and social reform gained ground in the 1960s and 1970s, activists increasingly looked beyond national borders to form alliances. Movements for women’s rights, nuclear disarmament, environmental protection, and addressing climate change all became both local and global efforts. For example, the global anti-apartheid movement kept pressure on nations to apply economic and political sanctions on the white-minority regime in South Africa. But at the same time, the antiapartheid movement served as a means to address local problems. For instance, in Brazil anti-apartheid activism helped draw attention to the country’s own racial inequalities, while in the United States anti-apartheid activism on college campuses helped students organize movements concerned with other issues such as gender equality. The 1977 Nestlé boycott exemplified the kinds of success such movements could achieve as well as their limitations. Critics charged that the Swiss company’s marketing of powdered baby formula in poor countries or regions with little access to clean water posed a risk to children. Activists called on consumers around the world to boycott Nestlé products. At first, Nestlé dismissed the boycott and sought to discredit the movement. The president of the company’s Brazilian division declared that “the US Nestlé Co has advised me that their research indicates that this [boycott] is actually an indirect attack on the free world’s economic system.” 3 Condemnation of Nestlé mounted. In a 1978 hearing, U.S. senator Ted Kennedy asked a Nestlé executive: “Can a product which requires clean water, good sanitation, adequate family income and a literate parent to follow printed instructions be properly and safely used in areas where water is contaminated, sewage runs in the streets, poverty is severe and illiteracy is high?”
4
In 1981 the UN World Health Organization responded to the campaign by developing a set of voluntary standards regulating the marketing of
 
infant formula in countries where access to clean water was precarious. Nestlé agreed to follow the standards. The movement succeeded, but its success raised questions: multinational corporations operated beyond the reach of single governments and often operated in regions with weak regulatory or investigatory structures. As a result, it was hard to hold them accountable when their conduct was unethical. At the same time, social movements and nongovernmental organizations also acted outside the realm of public accountability. Environmentalism The modern environmental movement began with concerns about chemical waste, rapid consumption of energy and food supplies, global deforestation, and threats to wildlife. By the 1970s citizens had begun joining together in nongovernmental organizations to pursue preservation or restoration of the natural environment. The environmental movement is actually several different movements, each with its own agenda. (See “Analyzing the Evidence: Protest Against Genetically Modified Foods,” at right.) American biologist and writer Rachel Carson was an early proponent of the environmental health movement. In Silent Spring (1962), she warned of the dangers of pesticides and pollution: Along with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man’s total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm — substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends.

Carson and others were concerned about the harmful effects of chemicals, radiation, pollution, waste, and urban development on the environment and on human health. Environmentalists like Carson acted out of concern that all living things were connected and that damage to one part of an ecological system could have consequences across that ecosystem. Environmentalists today are especially concerned about global warming, the increase of global temperatures over time caused by the buildup of carbon in the atmosphere that captures heat. As a result of global warming, average temperatures have increased worldwide in recent decades, a trend that most scientists expect will intensify without curbs on carbon emissions. The decade from 2000 to 2010 was the warmest in recorded history, and the decade beginning in 2010 is projected to be even warmer. Scientists believe that man-made climate change began with the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century. The subsequent release of hydrocarbons produced through the burning of fossil fuels — coal, oil, natural gas — has caused a greenhouse effect that traps these gases and heats up the earth’s atmosphere. Paradoxically, industrialization and increased consumption in the developing world meant diminished global inequalities but intensified global carbon emissions. global warming The consensus view of an overwhelming majority of the world’s scientists that hydrocarbons produced through the burning of fossil fuels have caused a greenhouse effect that has increased global temperatures over time. Scientists predict that the effects of global warming over the next century will include a catastrophic rise in sea levels that threatens to put many coastal cities and islands underwater; ecosystem changes that may threaten many species; destruction of the earth’s ozone layer, which shields the planet from harmful solar radiation; and a decline in agricultural production. Global Warming In the twenty-first century development pressures meet growing concern about climate change. International concerns over global warming resulted in a 1997 agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, which amended the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Countries that ratify the
 
Kyoto Protocol agree to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases. As of April 2014, 191 countries had ratified it. The most notable exception was the United States. The United Nations and environmental activists have continued to pursue an international environmental accord that can bring all nations into a shared effort to combat climate change. The U.S. government agreed to the voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions called for in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which would be achieved by changing regulations in areas such as electicity production.
 
ANALYZING THE EVIDENCE
Protest Against Genetically Modified Foods
The Chilean demonstrators in this photo are protesting the introduction of genetically modified crops. The banner reads, “I do not want transgenic crops in Chile: Movement for Food Sovereignty.” Worldwide, people oppose genetically modified (GMO) crops for a variety of reasons. Some opponents fear that GMO foods present unforeseen health risks. Other opponents believe that the proliferation of genetically modified crops could damage biodiversity by reducing the variety of strains that are planted; they are also concerned that gene transfer from GMOs, particularly through pollination, could be damaging to other plant species, as well as to other organisms such as bees. Some opponents also note that GMOs can undermine small farmers who cannot afford the patented seeds of multinational companies such as Monsanto, placing them at a disadvantage relative to large landowners and threatening their land tenure. The protesters in this image are members of a movement for food sovereignty that advocates for the production of crops from locally sourced seeds. Some are dressed as bees or clowns, and in the foreground a marcher dressed as the grim reaper bears a sign that reads, “Mon$anto patents your life.” QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS 1. What do the costumes suggest about the protesters’ views about the effects of genetically modified foods? 2. Examine the concerns of these protesters in the context of the promises of the green revolution. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of the scientific engineering of food crops?
