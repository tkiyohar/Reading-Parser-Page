SAPing the Third World
 
After their mysterious laughter, they quickly changed the topic to other things. How were people back home surviving SAP?

Slums, however deadly and insecure, have a brilliant future. The course tryside will for a short period still contain the majority of the world's poor, but that dubious distinction will pass to urban slums no later than 2035. At least half of the coming Third World urban population explosion will be credited to the account of informal communities. Two billion slum-dwellers by 2030 or 2040 is a monstrous, almost incomprehensible prospect, but urban poverty overlaps and exceeds alum populations per se. Researchers with the UN Urban Observatory project warn that by 2020, "urban poverty in the world could reach 45 to 50 percent of the total population living in the cities''
 
The evolution of this new urban poverty, as we have seen, has been & nonlinear historical process. The slow accretion of shantytowns to the shell of the city has been punctuated by storms of poverty and sudden explosions of shum-building. In his collection of stories entitled Adjusted Lives, the Nigerian writer Fidelis Balogun describes the coming of the IMF-mandated Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in the mid-1980s as the equivalent of a great natural disaster, destroying forever the old soul of Lagos and "re-enslaving" urban Nigerians.
 
The weird logic of this economic programme seemed to be that to restore life to the dying economy, every juice had first to be SAPed out of the under-privileged majority of the citizens. The middle class rapidly disappeared and the garbage heaps of the increasingly rich few became the food table of the multiplied population of abjectly poor. The brain drain to the oil-rich Arab countries and to the Western world became a flood.¹
 
Balogun's complaints about "privatizing in full stream and getting more hungry by the day," as well as his enumeration of SAPs' malevolent consequences, would be instantly familiar not only to survivors of the 30 other African SAPS, but also to hundreds of millions of Asians and Latin Americans. The 1980s - when the IMF and the World Bank used the leverage of debt to restructure the economies of most of the Third World - are the years when slums became an implacable future not just for poor rural migrants, but also for millions of traditional urbanites displaced or immiserated by the violence of "adjustment."
 
Urban Poverty's Big Bang
 
In 1974-75, the International Monetary Fund, followed by the World Bank, shifted focus from the developed industrial countries to a Third World reeling under the impact of soaring oil prices. As it increased its lending step by step, the IMF ratcheted up the scope of the coercive "conditionalities' ' and "structural adjustments' ' it imposed on clients. nations. As economist Frances Stewart emphasizes in her important study, the "exogenous developments that necessitated adjustment were not tackled by these institutions - the major ones being falling commodity prices and exorbitant debt servicing," but every domestic policy and public program was fair game for retrenchment. By August 1982,
 
When Mexico threatened to default on its loan repayments, both the IMF and the World Bank, in synchronization with the largest commercial banks, had become explicit instruments of the international capitalist revolution promoted by the Reagan, Thatcher, and Kohl regimes. The 1985 Baker Plan (named after then Secretary of Treasury James Baker but drafted by his deputy secretary, Richard Darman) bluntly required the 15 largest Third World debtors to abandon state led development strategies in return for new loan facilities and continued membership in the world economy. The Plan also pushed the World Bank to the fore as the long term manager of the scores of structural adjustment programs that were shaping the brave new world of the so-called "Washington Consensus."
 
This is, of course, a world in which the claims of foreign lanks and creditors always take precedence over the survival needs of the urban and rural poor; it is a world in which it is taken as "normal" that a poor country like Uganda spends twelve times as much per capita on debt relief each year as oa healthcare in the midst of the HIV/AIDS crisis. As The Challenge of Shims emphasizes, SAPS were "deliberately anti urban in nature," and designed to reverse any "urban bias" that previously existed in welfare policies, fiscal structure, or government investment. Everywhere the IMF and World Bank - acting as bailiffs for the big banks and backed by Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations - offered poor countries the same poisoned chalice of devaluation, privatization, removal of import controls and food subsidies, enforced cost-recovery in health and education, and ruthless downsizing of the public sector. (A notorious telegram from Treasury Secretary George Shultz to overseas USAID officials commanded: "In most cases, public sector firms should be privatized.")" At the same time SAPS devastated rural smallholders by eliminating subsidies and pushing them to sink or swim into global commodity markets dominated by heavily subsidized First World agribusiness.
 
Debt - as William Tabb reminds us in his recent history of global economic governance has been the forcing-house of an epochal transfer of power from Third World nations to the Bretton Woods institutions controlled by the United States and other core capitalist countries. According to Tabb, the Bank's professional staff are the postmodern equivalent of a colonial civil service, and "like the colonial administrators they never seem to go away except to be replaced by a fresh adviser team with the same outlook and powers over the local economy and society."
 
Although the debt-collectors claim to be in the business of economic development, they seldom allow poor nations to play by the same rules that richer countries used to promote growth in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. Structural adjustment, as economist Ha-Joon Chang points out in a valuable article, hypocritically "kicked away the ladder" of protectionist tariffs and subsidies that the OECD nations had historically employed in their own climb from economies based on agriculture to those based on urban high-value goods and services." Stefan Andreasson, looking at the grim results of SAPS in Zimbabwe and self-imposed neoliberal policies in South Africa, wonders if the Third World can hope for anything more than "virtual democracy" as long as its macroeconomic policies are dictated from Washington: "Virtual democracy comes at the expense of inclusive, participatory democracy and of any possibility of the extension of public welfare provision that social democratic projects elsewhere have entailed."'10
 
The Challenge of Slums makes the same point when it argues that the "main single cause of increases in poverty and inequality during the 1980s and 1990s was the retreat of the state." In addition to the direct SAP-enforced reductions in public-sector spending and ownership, the authors stress the more subtle diminution of state capacity that resulted from "subsidiarity": defined as the devolution of sovereign power to lower echelons of government, and especially NGOs, linked directly to major international aid agencies.
 
The whole, apparently decentralized structure is foreign to the notion of a national representative government that has served the developed world well, while it is very amenable to the operations of a global hegemony. The dominant international perspective [i.e., Washington's] becomes the de facto paradigm for development, so that the whole world rapidly becomes unified in the broad direction of what is supported by donors and international organizations.¹¹
 
Urban Africa and Latin America were the hardest hit by the artificial depression engineered by the IMF and the White House - indeed, in many countries the economic impact of SAPS during the 1980s, in tandem with protracted drought, rising oil prices, soaring interest rates, and falling commodity prices, was more severe and long-lasting. than the Great Depression. Third World cities, especially, were trapped in a vicious cycle of increasing immigration, decreasing formal employment, falling wages, and collapsing revenues. The IMF and World Bank, as we have seen, promoted regressive taxation through public-service user fees for the poor, but made no counterpart effort to reduce military expenditure or to tax the incomes or real estate of the rich. As a result, infrastructure and public health everywhere lost the race with population increase. In Kinshasa, writes Theodore Trefon, "the population refers to basic public services as 'memories.''12
 
The balance sheet of structural adjustment in Africa, reviewed by Carole Rakodi, includes capital flight, collapse of manufactures, marginal or negative increase in export incomes, drastic cutbacks in urban public services, soaring prices, and a steep decline in real wages. 13 Across the continent people learned to say "I have the crisis" in the same way one says, "I have a cold."* In Dar-es-Salaam, public-service expenditure per person fell 10 percent per annum during the 1980s, a virtual demolition of the local state. 15 In Khartoum, liberalization and structural adjustment, according to local researchers, manufactured 1.1 million "new poor," most out of the decimated ranks of the public sector. In Abidjan, one of the few tropical African cities with an important manufacturing sector and modern urban services, submis sion to the SAP regime punctually led to deindustrialization, the collapse of construction, and a rapid deterioration in public transit and sanitation; as a result, urban poverty in Ivory Coast - the supposed "tiger" economy of West Africa - doubled in the year 1987-88.¹7 In Balogun's Nigeria, extreme poverty, increasingly urbanized in Lagos, Ibadan, and other cities, metastasized from 28 percent in 1980 to 66 percent in 1996. "GNP per capita is about $260 today," the World Bank reports, "below the level at independence 40 years ago and below the $370 level attained in 1985.18 Overall, geographer Deborah Potts points out, wages have fallen so low in African cities that researchers can't figure how the poor manage to survive: this is the so-called "wage puzzle."19
 
In Latin America, beginning with General Pinochet's neoliberal coup in 1973, structural adjustment was closely associated with military dictatorship and the repression of the popular Left. One of the most striking results of this hemispheric counter-revolution was the rapid urbanization of poverty. In 1970, Guevara's foco theories of rural insurgency still conformed to a continental reality where the poverty of the countryside (75 million poor) overshadowed that of the cities (44 million poor). By the end of the 1980s, however, the vast majority of the poor (115 million) were living in urban colonias, barri adas, and, villas miserias rather than on farms or in rural villages (80 million).20
 
According to ILO research, urban poverty in Latin America rose by an extraordinary 50 percent just in the first half of the decade, 1980 to 1986 21 The average incomes of the working population fell by 40 percent in Venezuela, 30 percent in Argentina, and 21 percent in Brazil and Costa Rica.22 In Mexico informal employment almost doubled between 1980 and 1987, while social expenditure fell to half its 1980 level. 23 In Peru the 1980s ended in an SAP-induced "hyper-recession" that cut formal employment from 60 to 11 percent of the urban workforce in three years and opened the doors of Lima's slums to the occult revolution of Sendero Luminoso.24
 
Meanwhile, broad sections of the educated middle class, accustomed to live-in servants and European vacations, suddenly found themselves in the ranks of the new poor. In some cases, downward mobility was almost as abrupt as in Africa: the percentage of the urban population living in poverty, for example, increased by 5 percent in a single year (1980-81) in both Chile and Brazil. 25 But the same adjust: ments that crushed the poor and the public-sector middle class offered lucrative opportunities to privatizers, foreign importers, narcotraficantes, military brass, and political insiders. Conspicuous consumption reached hallucinatory levels in Latin America and Africa during the 1980s as the nouveaux riches went on spending sprees in Miami and Paris while their shantytown compatriots starved.
 
Indices of inequality reached record heights in the 1980s. In Buenos Aires the richest decile's share of income increased from 10 times that of the poorest in 1984 to 23 times in 1989. In Rio de Janeiro, inequality as measured in classical GINI coefficients climbed from 0.58 in 1981 to 0.67 in 1989.26 Indeed, throughout Latin America, the 1980s deepened the canyons and elevated the peaks of the world's most extreme social topography. According to a 2003 World Bank report, GINI coefficients are 10 points higher in Latin America than Asia; 17.5 points higher than the OECD; and 20.4 points higher than Eastern Europe. Even the most egalitarian country in Latin America, Uruguay, has a more unequal distribution of income than any European country.27
 
Adjustment from Below
 
Everywhere in the Third World, the economic shocks of the 1980s forced individuals to regroup around the pooled resources of households and, especially, the survival skills and desperate ingenuity of women. As male formal employment opportunities disappeared, mothers, sisters, and wives were typically forced to bear far more than half the weight of urban structural adjustment: "While the burdens of survival [for the family] are enormous," writes an Indian scholar, "those of the women are even greater."28 As geographer Sylvia Chant emphasizes, poor urban women under SAPs had to work harder both inside and outside the home to compensate for cuts in social service expenditures and male incomes; simultaneously new or increased user fees further limited their access to education and healthcare." Somehow they were expected to cope. Indeed, some researchers argue that SAPS cynically exploit the belief that women's labor-power is almost infinitely elastic in the face of household survival needs.30 This is the guilty secret variable in most neoclassical equations of economic adjustment: poor women and their children are expected to lift the weight of Third World debt upon their shoulders.
 
Thus, in China and the industrializing cities of Southeast Asia, millions of young women indentured themselves to assembly lines and factory squalor. "Women," according to recent research, make up 90 percent of the 27 or so million workers in Free Trade Zones."31 In Africa and most of Latin America (Mexico's northern border cities excepted), this option did not exist. Instead, deindustrialization and the decimation of male formal-sector jobs, often followed by male emigra tion, compelled women to improvise new livelihoods as piece-workers, liquor sellers, street vendors, lottery ticket sellers, hairdressers, sewing operators, cleaners, washers, ragpickers, nannies, and prostitutes. In a region where urban women's labor-force participation had always been lower than in other continents, the surge of Latin American women into tertiary informal activities during the 1980s was especially dramatic. In her detailed study of "adjustment from below," social anthropologist Caroline Moser describes the impact of eight successive SAPS between 1982 and 1988 on a formerly upwardly mobile shantytown on the swampy edge of Guayaquil. Although open unemployment doubled in Ecuador, the major impact of the 1980s crisis was an explosion of underemployment estimated at fully half the workforce in both Guayaquil and Quito. In the barrio Indio Guayas, husbands who had previously enjoyed full-time work found themselves casualized and idle for up to a half a year; households, as a consequence, were forced to send more members out to work, both women and children. The female participation rate increased from 40 to 52 percent after the onset of the SAPS, but, with a decline in factory employment, women were forced to compete with each other for jobs as domestics or as street vendors. Despite this total mobilization of all household resources, living conditions, especially children's nutrition, declined dramatically. Moser found that almost 80 percent of the barrie's children suffered some symptom of malnutrition. Healthcare, now largely privatized and more expensive, was no longer within reach of the formerly optimistic families of Indio Guayas.³2
 
The Guayaquil experience was mirrored in Guadalajara during the neoliberal aftermath of the debt crisis of 1982. In a city that had traditionally been Mexico's capital of small-scale family-owned factories and workshops, the free fall in wages and the collapse of social expenditure in the early 1980s was followed, after the GATT agreement of 1986, by ruthless foreign competition. Guadalajara's specialized niche - the small workshop production of mass consumer goods - couldn't survive the full onslaught of East Asian imports. The result - according to research by Augustín Escobar and Mercedes González - was simultaneously a huge increase in informal employment (by at least 80 percent between 1980 and 1987), emigration to California and Texas, and even more importantly, the restructuring of formal jobs "with precarious employment becoming the norm. Jobs are no longer secure, part-time employment becomes more common, out contracting to smaller firms becomes general practice, and workers and employees are asked to perform more duties in order to remain in work." The household response, as in Guayaquil, was to send more females into domestic service, and also take their kids out of school to go to work. These short-term survival strategies, Escobar and González warned, would ultimately impair long-term economic mobility. "Worsening economic conditions limit the capacity of urban working-class households to implement long term social mobility strategies, since it forces them to mobilize their inner resources and make extensive use of their labor force for basic survival.33
 
As in Africa and Asia, many Latin American urban families also "adjusted to adjustment" by sending dependent members back to the countryside, where subsistence was cheaper. "In Costa Rica," writes Cedric Pugh, "men and women split their households, with women and children often being constrained to migrate to poorer regions where housing outlays could be economized. Sometimes this added to separation and divorce with long-term consequences for living standards and the demand for housing among split households.""34
 
The urban African experience has been even more harrowing since women and children have had to negotiate the AIDS holocaust (itself partly due to the poverty-enforced prostitution of poor women) and frequently, drought and civil war as well as structural adjustment. In Harare the 1991 SAP raised the cost of living 45 percent in a single year and 100,000 people ended up in hospital wards suffering from effects of malnutrition. As both Nazneen Kanji and Christian Rogerson have recounted in separate studies, ruthless competition has become the norm in the informal market economy - especially for market women and street vendors - as women struggle to provide food for their families: "Generally speaking, the incomes generated from these enterprises, the majority of which tend to be run by women, usually fall short of even minimum income standards and involve little capital investment, virtually no skills training, and only constrained opportunities for expansion into a viable business.''35 Meanwhile, as infant mortality. doubled, AIDS spread and children's nutrition declined, desperate mothers in Harare sent young children back to the countryside or regrouped previously independent family members into extended households to save on rent and electricity. Tens of thousands of older children were forced to drop out of school in order to work or slavenge, with little hope of ever returning to education. Often the myriad pressures were too overwhelming and family solidarity itself collapsed. According to one group of researchers, "what may once have been a unit that supported and sustained its members has now become a unit in which members compete for survival.""7
 
Rather than see their families destroyed, however, slum-dwellers in the late 1970s and 1980s, generally with women in the forefront, resurrected and reshaped that classical protest of the urban poor, the food riot. The slums of Africa, Latin American, and South Asia did not go gently into the IMF's good night instead they exploded. In their path breaking study of grassroots resistance to structural adjustment (Free Markets and Food Riots, 2004), John Walton and David Seddon cataloged 146 "IMP riots'' in 39 debtor countries from 1976 to 1992.38 Whatever elements of a "human face" - the so-called "social dimensions of adjustment" - could be attributed to SAPS in the early 1990s were largely retrofitted in response to this extraordinary eruption of global protest.
 
The international dimensions of austerity are recognized symbolically in attacks on travel agencies, foreign automobiles, luxury hotels, and international agency offices. Protests take varied forms, often appearing as classic food riots (Morocco, Brazil, Haiti) and at other times as peaceful protest demonstrations that turned violent (Sudan, Turkey, Chile) or as general strikes (Peru, Bolivia, India). Frequently, however, protest initiated with one of these tactics is transformed to another - demonstrations turn to net, spontaneous violence is rechanneled in political organization.
 
The food riot as a means of popular protest is a common, perhaps even universal, feature of market societies = less a vestige of political industrial evolution than a strategy of empowerment in which poor and dispossessed groups assert their claims to social justice. In the modern system of states and international economic integration, the explosive point of popular protest has moved, with most of the world's population, to the cities where the processes of global accumulation, national development, and popular justice intersect. 3
 
The first wave of anti-IMF protests peaked between 1983 and 1985, only to be followed by a second wave after 1989. In Caracas in February 1989 a hugely unpopular IMF-dictated increase in fuel prices and transit fares sparked a riot by angry bus riders and radical university students, and police batons quickly turned the confrontation into a semi-insurrection. During the week-long Caracazo, tens of thousands of poor people came down from their hillside barrios to loot shopping centers, burn luxury cars, and build barricades. At least 400 were killed. A month later Lagos erupted after student protests against the IMF: 50 died in three days of looting and street fighting in a city where most poor people probably shared the boiling anger of "the King'' in Chris Abani's novel Graceland: The majority of our people are honest, hard working people. But they are at the mercy of dese army bastards and do tiefs in the IMF, the World Bank and de U.S.... Now we, you and I and all these poor people, owe the World Bank ten million dollars for nothing. Dey are all tiefs and I despise dem - our people and de World Bank people!40
 
The Utopian Decade?
 
According to both neoclassical theory and World Bank projections, the 1990s should have righted the wrongs of the 1980s and allowed Third World cities to regain lost ground and bridge the chasms of inequality created by the SAPS; the pain of adjustment should have been followed by the analgesic of globalization. Indeed, the 1990s, as The Challenge of Shums wryly notes, were the first decade in which global urban development took place within almost utopian parameters of neoclassical market freedom.
 
During the 1990s, trade continued to expand at an almost unprecedented rate, no-go areas opened up and military expenditures decreased. All the basic inputs to production became cheaper, as interest rates fell rapidly along with the price of basic commodities. Capital flows were increasingly unfettered by national controls and could move rapidly to the most productive areas. Under what were almost perfect economic conditions according to the dominant neoliberal economic doctrine, one might have imagined that the decade would have been one of unrivaled prosperity and social justice.¹¹
 
However, according to the UN's Human Development Report 2004, "an unprecedented number of countries saw development slide backwards in the 1990s. In 46 countries people are poorer today than in 1990. In 25 countries more people are hungry today than a decade ago.2 Throughout the Third World a new wave of SAPs and self-imposed neoliberal programs accelerated the demolition of state employment, local manufacturing, and home-market agriculture. The big industrial metropolises of Latin America Mexico City, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and Buenos Aires - suffered massive losses of manufacturing jobs. In São Paulo the manufacturing share of employment fell from 40 percent in 1980 to 15 percent in 2004.43 The cost of servicing debt (which in a country like Jamaica ate up 60 percent of the budget in the late 1990s) absorbed resources for social programs and housing assistance: it is the "social abandonment" of the urban poor, in the words of Don Robotham."
 
The World Bank, for its part, applauded the disappearing role of the local state in Urban Policy and Economic Development: An Agenda for the 1990s (1991), a document that reconceptualized the public sector as a simple "enabler" of the marketplace. "With a central focus on the revalorization of market mechanisms," explains geographer Cecilia Zanetta in a review of the Bank's urban programs in Mexico and Argentina, "sound urban policies were now defined as those aimed at eliminating barriers that restricted the productivity of urban economic agents, both formal and informal, so as to maximize their contribution to the national economy."'45 This fetishization of "urban productivity,'' in fact, led to massive pressure to privatize utilities and urban services, regardless of impacts on employment or equitable distribution. As far as the World Bank was concerned, there was no chance that public-sector employment would regain lost ground in the 1990s.
 
The boom in exports all too frequently benefited only a tiny stratum. One of the most extreme cases was Angola, a major producer of oil and diamonds. In Luanda, where in 1993 a staggering 84 percent of the population was jobless or underemployed, inequality between the highest and lowest income deciles ``increased from a factor of 10 to a factor of 37 between 1995 and 1998 alone.''46 In Mexico the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty increased from 16 percent in 1992 to 28 percent in 1999, despite the much-hyped "success stories'' of the border maquiladoras and NAFTA," Likewise in Colombia, where urban wages declined, but coca acreage tripled during the regime of César Gaviria (elected in 1990), the drug cartels, according to an OECD report, "were among the most consistently favorable to his neoliberal policies." Global inequality, as measured by World Bank economists across the entire world population, reached an incredible GINI coefficient level of 0.67 by the end of the century this is mathematically equivalent to a situation where the poorest two thirds of the world receive zero income, and the top third receives everything.``
 
Global turmoil at the the end of the decade, moreover, could be mapped with uncanny accuracy to cities and regions that experienced the sharpest increases in inequality. Throughout the Middle East and Muslim South Asia, a widening gulf between urban rich and poor cor roborated the arguments of Islamists and even more radical Salafists about the irreformabie corruption of ruling regimes. A final assault on the "socialist" remnants of the FLN state in Algeria began in 1995 with the privatization of 230 firms and the firing of 130,000 state workers; poverty shot up from 15 percent in 1988 to 23 percent in 1995.50 Likewise, in Tehran, as the Islamic Revolution backed away from its original pro-poor policies, poverty sharply rose from 26 to 31 percent between 1993 and 1995.51 In Egypt, despite five years of economic growth, 1999 World Bank data showed no decrease in house hold poverty (defined as an income of $610 or less per year) but did register a fall in per capita consumption. 52 Pakistan similarly faced a dual crisis of declining industrial competitiveness, as its textile exports were imperiled by China, and agricultural productivity declined due to chronic underinvestment in irrigation. As a result, the wages of casual and informal labor fell, poverty soared at a pace which the National Human Development Report characterized as "unprecedented in Pakistan's history, and urban income inequality, as measured by the GINI coefficient, increased from 31.7 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1998.53
 
The biggest event of the 1990s, however, was the conversion of much of the former "Second World'' - European and Asian state socialism - into a new Third World. In the early 1990s those considered to be living in extreme poverty in the former "transitional countries," as the UN calls them, rocketed from 14 million to 168 million: an almost instantaneous mass pauperization without precedent in history. Poverty, of course, did exist in the former USSR in an unacknowledged form, but according to World Bank researchers, the rate did not exceed 6 to 10 percent. Now, according to Alexey Krasheninnokov, in his report to UN-HABITAT, 60 percent of Russian families live in poverty, and the rest of the population "can only be categorized as middle class by a considerable stretch." ("Middle-class" Russians, for example, spend 40 percent of their income on food as compared to a global middle-income standard of less than one-third.) 56
 
Although the worst "transitional poverty" is hidden from view in derelict regions of the ex-Soviet countryside, the cities display shocking new extremes of overnight wealth and equally sudden misery. In St. Petersburg, for example, income inequality between the richest and poorest decile soared from 4.1 in 1989 to 13.2 in 1996.57 Moscow may now have more billionaires than New York, but it also has more than one million squatters, many of them illegal immigrants from the Ukraine (200,000), China (150,000), Vietnam, and Moldavia; these people live in primitive conditions in abandoned buildings, rundown dormitories, and former barracks. Sweatshop firms, often praised in the West as the vanguard of capitalism, "prefer to employ [these] outlaws, to pay them miserable salaries, and house 10 to 15 in one room apartments," while not paying any payroll taxes at all.58 Russian researchers estimate that the informal or shadow economy probably equals 40 percent of the turnover of the formal economy.
 
In the old Soviet Union urban housing was rationed but virtually free - 2 to 3 percent of household income was typically expended for rent and utilities and depended upon a unique social infrastructure of district heating, subways, and workplace-based culture and recreation. Since the late 1990s, however, the government of Vladimir Putin has accepted IMF stipulations to raise payments for housing and heating to market level, despite a fall in incomes. Simultaneously, there has been massive neglect, disinvestment, even abandonment of the crucial district infrastructures and factory-based social services, and as a result, older apartment blocks - indeed, whole neighborhoods, and sometimes entire cities have regressed to slum conditions. Many working-class residential areas are characterized by broken pipes, overflowing sewers, faulty lighting, and, most dangerously, no winter heat. Millions of poor urban Russians, as a result, suffer conditions of cold, hunger, and isolation reminiscent of the siege of Leningrad during the Second World War.
 
Russian-style transitional poverty also exists in urban Eastern Europe, most notably in Bulgaria and Albania. In Sofia, hammered by deindustrialization and plant closures, poverty and inequality exploded in 1995-96, especially amongst Roma and Turkish minorities, older women, and large families: 43 percent of Bulgarians now live below the poverty line, and Sofia probably has the largest slum population in Europe. It also has Europe's most wretched slum, "Cambodia" in Fakulteta, where 35,000 Roma (90 percent of them unemployed) live under ghetto conditions that recall the misery of Dalits in India. Europe's poorest city, however, is Elbasan (population 110,000), the former heavy industrial center of Albania which now survives only thanks to the remittances of its many emigrants in Italy and Greece. Tiana, meanwhile, is surrounded by burgeoning peri-urban shanty towns, with some poor people squatting in the ubiquitous pillboxes built by the paranoid Hoxha dictatorship.62
 
Success Stories?
 
Globalization's two great success stories in the 1990s were the continuing jobs-and-income boom in China's coastal cities and the emergence of an "India Shining '' of high-tech enclaves and office parks. In both cases, development was no illusion: the forest of sky cranes around Shanghai, as well as new shopping malls and Starbucks in Bangalore, testify to economic dynamism, but these market miracles were purchased at high costs in increased economic inequality.
 
Since the late 1970s, the distribution of income and wealth in China's cities has gone from the most egalitarian in Asia to one of the most egregiously unequal. Indeed, as Azizur Khan and Carl Riskin point out in a seminal study, "the increase in urban inequality was proportionately greater than the increase in rural inequality.''63 Juxtaposed with the nouveaux riches are the new urban poor: on one hand, deindustrialized traditional workers, and on the other, unregistered labor migrants from the countryside. Chinese city folk no longer "eat from the same big pot" as in austere but secure Maoist times. In September 1997 President Jiang Zemin told a Communist Party conference that "workers should change their ideas about employment." In a dynamic market society, he argued, cradle-to-grave social security was no longer feasible. This has meant the downsizing or even loss of a social safety net for the tens of millions of industrial workers and state employees restructured out of their jobs in recent years. Between 1996 and 2001 the number of state-owned industrial companies was reduced by 40 percent and a staggering 36 million workers were made redundant. Officially there was little rise in unemployment, but this was statistical sleight of hand, because laid-off state workers were put into a special "off post" category that didn't count them as jobless since they still received some social security benefits through their work unit. In reality, urban unemployment is estimated to be between 8 percent and 13 percent. An unusually high percentage of redundant workers are women because, according to journalist Pamela Yatsko, the bureau chief for the Far Eastern Economic Review, "the government estimated that laid-off women would be less of a security threat than jobless men." Former female industrial workers - welders, lathe operators, and shipbuilders - are now forced to hunt for low-paying service-sector jobs as maids, waitresses, nannies, or street vendors.65
 
Yet Mao's ex-heroes of history retain, for the most part, the privileges of official urban status and usually some security of tenure. The "peasant flood," however, enjoys official social rights only in the impoverished villages from which they have fled. An estimated 3 million migrant workers in Shanghai, for example, currently lack medical insurance, social welfare, or benefits of any kind. Migrants have also become the scapegoats for the contradictions of the new urban market economy. Some observers have compared the caste-like discrimination against rural migrants in contemporary urban China to that of "Black people in South Africa before the 1990s or of blacks and Asians in the United States throughout the first half of the twen tieth century."66 Indeed, Yatsko found recurrent scenes in Shanghai during the late 1990s that were disturbingly reminiscent of the evil city of the 1930s.
 
The city, like others in China, only allows migrants to do certain low status jobs, barring them from better jobs and kicking them out of the city if they cannot prove they are employed. Migrants mix little with the Shanghainese, who hold their country cousins in contempt and automatically blame them first when a crime is committed in the city. The majority of migrant workers are men who find work on the city's omnipresent construction sites. They sleep at night in makeshift barracks on the site, rent cheap accommodation on the city's outskirts, or grab a slab of pavement if they have not yet found a job. Migrant women sometimes work as maids for Shanghai families or in decrepit barbershops in bad parts of town, washing hair for 10 yuan (US $1.20) a head and, in some cases, providing sexual services for a bit more. Smudge-faced migrant waifs in rags, with or without their mothers, regularly beg for spare change outside popular watering holes, particularly those frequented by foreigners.67
 
Chinese officials, not unjustifiably, extol the indices of national economic progress, especially the incredible 10 percent yearly increase in GDP since 1980; they are less forthcoming about poverty and deprivation. By official admission, Chinese social indicators are highly unreliable. In 2002 the leading government think tank, the Development Research Center of the State Council, warned that urban poverty had been radically underestimated. It proposed raising the official figure from 14.7 million to at least 37.1 million, although it acknowledged that this revision still failed to include tens of millions of laid-off employees or the 100 million "floating workers'' still counted as farmers.68 Urban poverty in India is more honestly acknowledged and publicly
 
debated than in China, but local social scientists and social-justice activists trying to focus public attention on the underside of the recent economic growth have also had to swim against the current of celebratory official rhetoric As any reader of the business press knows, the drastic neoliberal restructuring of the Indian economy after 1991 produced a high-tech boom and stock-market bubble whose frenzied epicenters were a handful of Cinderella cities: Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, and Chennai. GDP grew at 6 percent during the 1990s, while the capitalization of the Bombay Stock Exchange doubled almost every year and one result was one million new millionaires, many of them Indian engineers and computer scientists returned from Sunnyvale and Redmond. Less publicized, however, was the accompanying growth in poverty: India gained 56 million more paupers in the course of the "boom." Indeed, as Jeremy Seabrook underlines, the early 1990s may have been "the worst time for the poor since Independence," as deregulated food grain prices soared 58 percent between 1991 and 1994.69
 
Growth has been stupendously lopsided, with enormous speculative investment in the information technology sector leaving agriculture to stagnate and infrastructure to decay. Rather than taxing new millionaires, the neoliberal Janata government financed itself with the massive privatization of state industry, thanks to which Enron now sells electricity near Bombay at three times the rate of the public utility. Neoliberal policies, like those in China, have wreaked havoc in the neglected Indian countryside, where three quarters of households lack access to sanitation and unpolluted drinking water, and the poor shout futilely for "Bijli, Sadaak, Paani'' ("Electricity, Roads, and Water"). As Praful Bidwai reported in the Asian Times in 2000:
 
Infant mortality rates are rising even in states like Kerala and Maharashtra, which have relatively good social indicators.... The government is cutting spending on rural development, including agricultural programs, and rural employment and anti-poverty schemes, as well as on health, drinking water supply, education and sanitation. Income growth in the rural areas, where 70 percent of Indians live, averaged 3.1 in the 1980s. It has sharply declined to 1.8 percent. Real wages of rural workers decreased last year by more than 2 percent.70
 
While the urban middle classes indulge their new tastes for California style tract homes and health clubs, the defeated rural poor have been killing themselves in droves. In Andhra Pradesh alone, wrote journalist Edward Luce in July 2004, "500 of its farmers have committed suicide this year alone, often by drinking the pesticide that was purchased with debts they could not repay." 71 Increased despair in the countryside, in turn, has dislodged vast numbers of poor farmers and laborers whose only alternative has been migration to the slum outskirts of high-tech boomtowns like Bangalore.
 
As the headquarters of India's software and computer-service indus series, as well as a major center for the manufacture of military aircraft, Bangalore (population 6 million) prides itself on its California-style shopping malls, golf courses, nouvelle cuisine restaurants, five-star hotels, and English-language cinemas. Dozens of tech campuses display logos for Oracle, Intel, Dell, and Macromedia, and local universities and technical institutes graduate 40,000 skilled workers and engineers each year. Bangalore advertises itself as a "prosperous garden city," and its southern suburbs are indeed a middle-class Shangri-la. Meanwhile, draconian urban renewal programs have driven underprivileged residents from the center to the slum periphery, where they live side by side with poor migrants from the countryside. An estimated 2 million poor people, many of them scorned members of the scheduled castes, squat in 1000 or so fetid slums, mostly on government-owned land. Slums have grown twice as fast as the general population, and researchers have characterized Bangalore's periphery as "the dumping ground for those urban residents whose labor is wanted in the urban economy but whose visual presence should be reduced as much as possible."??
 
Half of Bangalore's population lacks piped water, much less cappuccino, and there are more ragpickers and street children (90,000) than software geeks (about 60,000). In an archipelago of 10 slums, researchers found only 19 latrines for 102,000 residents." Solomon Benjamin, a Bangalore-based consultant for the UN and the World Bank, reports that "children suffered heavily from diarrhea and worm infestations, a high proportion were malnourished, and infant mortality rates in the slums were much higher than the state average." By the millennium, moreover, India's and Bangalore's neoliberal bubble had burst: although software continued to grow, "employment prospects in almost all other sectors, especially the public sector, have shrunk rapidly or face unstable prospects. Thus the granite, steel and tinted glass offices in Bangalore, most of them belonging to software companies, pose a stark contrast to ill-maintained factories facing falling orders and tighter credit conditions." Ruefully, a leading Western economic consultant was forced to concede that "Bangalore's high tech [boom] is a drop in the bucket in a sea of poverty.""75
