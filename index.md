II. Chief of Security Police and Security Service, SS-Lieutenant General Heydrich, opened the meeting by informing everyone that the Reich Marshal [Göring] had placed him in charge of preparations for the final solution of the Jewish question, and that the invitations to this conference had been issued to obtain clarity in fundamental questions. The Reich Marshal's wish to have a draft submitted to him on the organizational, functional, and material considerations aimed at a final solution of the European Jewish question requires that all of the central agencies, which are directly concerned with these problems, first join together with a view to parallelizing their lines of action.

The implementation of the final solution of the Jewish question is to be guided centrally without regard to geographic boundaries from the office of the Reichsführer-SS and Chief of the German Police (Chief of Security Police and Security Service).

The Chief of Security Police and Security Service then reviewed briefly the battle fought thus far against these opponents. The principal stages constituted

a) Forcing the Jews out of individual sectors of life [Lebens gebiete] of the German people

b) Forcing the Jews out of the living space [Lebensraum] of the German people

In pursuance of this endeavor, a systematic and concentrated effort was made to accelerate Jewish emigration from Reich territory as the only temporary solution possibility. On instructions of the Reich Marshal, a Reich Central Office

for Jewish Emigration was established in January, 1939, and its direction was entrusted to the Chief of the Security Police and Security Service. In particular the office had the task of a) taking every step to prepare for a larger volume of Jewish emigration,

b) steering the flow of emigration,

c) expediting emigration in individual cases.

The goal of the task was to cleanse the German living space of Jews in a legal manner.

The disadvantages brought forth by such forcing of emigration were clear to every agency. In the meantime, however, they had to be accepted for the lack of any other solution possibility.

The migration work in the ensuing period was not only a German problem, but also one that concerned the offices of the countries of destination and immigration. Financial difficulties, such as increasingly demanding regulations on the part of various foreign governments for money to be shown by the immigrant or to be paid by him on landing, insufficient berths on ships, constantly increasing immigration restrictions and suspensions-all this placed extraordinary burdens on emigra tion efforts. In spite of these difficulties, some 537,000 Jews were moved out from the day of the seizure of power to October 31, 1941. Of this total

from January 30, 1933 out of the Old Reich ca. 360,000

from March 15, 1938 out of Austria

from March 15, 1939 out of the Protectorate

Bohemia and Moravia

ca. 147,000

ca.

30,000

The emigration was financed by the Jews (or Jewish political organizations) themselves. In order to avoid having a residue of proletarianized Jews, the Jews with means had to finance the departure of the Jews without means; an appropriate assessment and emigration tax were used to finance the payments of debts owed by the poor Jews in the course of their emigration.

In addition to this levy in Reichsmark, foreign currencies were required for showing or payment on landing. In order to spare German foreign currency reserves, the Jewish financial institutions abroad were called upon by Jewish organizations at home to take care of the collection of an appropriate foreign currency pile. In this manner about $9,500,000 were made available through these foreign Jews as gifts to October 30, 1941.

Meanwhile, in view of the dangers of emigration in time of war and in view of the possibilities in the east, the Reichsfüh rer mathcal SS and Chief of the German Police [Himmler] has forbidden the emigration of Jews.

III. In lieu of emigration, the evacuation of the Jews to the east has emerged, after an appropriate prior authorization by Führer [Hitler], as a further solution.

While these actions are to be regarded solely as temporary measures, practical experiences are already being gathered here which will be of great importance during the coming final solution of the Jewish question.

Around 11 million Jews are involved in this final solution of the Jewish question. They are distributed as follows among individual countries:

B.

Bulgaria

48,000

England

Finland

2,300

Ireland

4,000

Italy, including Sardinia

58,000

Albania

200

Croatia

40,000

Portugal

3,000

Roumania, including Bessarabia

342,000

Sweden

8,000

Switzerland

18,000

Serbia

10,000

Slovakia

88,000

Spain

6,000

Turkey (European portion)

55,500

Hungary USSR

742,800

Ukraine

2,994,684

White Russia, excluding

Bialystok

446,484

Total: over 11,000,000

So far as the Jews of the various foreign countries are con-. cerned, the numbers listed include only Jews by religion, since definitions of Jews according to racial principles are in part

still lacking there. Given prevailing attitudes and conceptions, the treatment of the problem in individual countries will encounter certain difficulties, especially in Hungary and Rou mánia. For example, even today a Jew in Roumania can buy for cash appropriate documents officially certifying him in a foreign nationality.

The pervasive influence of Jewry in the USSR is known. The European area contains some 5 million, the Asian barely a half million Jews.

The occupational distribution of Jewry in the European area of the USSR was approximately as follows:agriculture

9.1%

urban workers

trade

14.8% 20.0%

23.4%

32.7%

state employees

private professions medical, press, theater, and so forth

In the course of the final solution, the Jews should be brought under appropriate direction in a suitable manner to the east for labor utilization. Separated by sex, the Jews capa ble of work will be led into these areas in large labor columns to build roads, whereby doubtless a large part will fall away through natural reduction.

The inevitable final remainder which doubtless constitutes the toughest element will have to be dealt with appropriately, since it represents natural selection which upon liberation is to be regarded as a germ cell of a new Jewish development. (See the lesson of history.)

In the course of the practical implementation of the final solution, Europe will be combed from west to east. If only because of the apartment shortage and other socio-political necessities, the Reich area-including the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia-will have to be placed ahead of the line.

For the moment, the evacuated Jews will be brought bit by bit to so-called transit ghettos from where they will be transported further to the east.

SS-Lieutenant General Heydrich pointed out further that an important prerequisite for the evacuation in general was the exact specification of the category of persons liable to be involved.

It is intended not to evacuate Jews over 65, but to transfer them to an old people's ghetto (the plan calls for Theresien stadt).

In addition to these age groups-some 30% of the 280,000 Jews who lived in the Old Reich and Austria on October 1,

1941, are over 65-the old people's ghetto will receive badly invalided Jewish war veterans and Jews with war decorations (Iron Cross First Class). Many intercessions will be eliminated in one blow by means of this purposeful solution.

The start of major individual evacuation operations will depend in large measure on military developments. With regard to the treatment of the final solution in European areas occupied or influenced by us, it was proposed that the appropriate specialists of the Foreign Office get together with the experts having jurisdiction in these matters within the Security Police and Security Service.

In Slovakia and Croatia the situation is no longer all that difficult, since the essential key questions there have already been resolved. Meanwhile, the Romanian government has already appointed a plenipotentiary for Jewish affairs. To set tle the matter in Hungary, it will be necessary before long to impose upon the Hungarian government an adviser on Jewish

questions.

Regarding a start of preparations in Italy, SS-Lieutenant General Heydrich considers it appropriate to contact Police Chief [Himmler].

In occupied and unoccupied France, the seizure of Jews for evacuation should in all probability proceed without major difficulty.

Assistant Secretary Luther [Foreign Office] then pointed out that with a deeply penetrating treatment of these problems in some countries, such as the Nordic states, difficulties would emerge and that meanwhile it would therefore be best to hold these countries in abeyance. In view of the insignificant number of Jews involved there, the postponement would not amount to a substantial restriction. On the other hand, the Foreign Office sees no major difficulties in southeastern and western Europe.

SS-Major General Hofmann intends to dispatch a specialist of the Race and Resettlement Office for general orientation to Hungary as soon as the Chief of Security Police and Security Service is about to tackle the situation over there. It was decided that temporarily the specialist of the Race and Resettlement Office-who is not to become active-should be officially attached as an assistant to the Police Attaché.

IV. The Nuremberg laws should constitute the basis, so to speak, of the final solution project, while a solution of the mixed marriage and mixed parentage questions is a prerequisite for the complete purification of the problem.

The Chief of the Security Police and Security Service ad dressed himself to a letter of the Chief of the Reich Chancellery, and speaking theoretically for the moment, dealt with the following points:

1. Treatment of Mischlinge of the 1st degree

In view of the final solution of the Jewish question Mischlinge of the first degree are placed into the same position as Jews.

To be excepted from this treatment will be

a) Mischlinge of the 1st degree married to Germans, if this marriage produced offspring (Mischlinge of the 2nd de

gree). These Mischlinge of the 2nd degree are in the main placed into the same position as Germans.

b) Mischlinge of the 1st degree who in some (vital) area have been accorded exceptional treatment by the higher authorities of the party or state. Each individual case has to be examined anew, whereby one must not exclude an unfavorable decision for the Mischling.

Prerequisite for an exemption must always be basic merits of the Mischling himself (not merits of the German parent or marital partner).

To avoid any progeny and to clean up the Mischling problem once and for all, the Mischlinge of the 1st degree who are to be exempted from evacuation must be sterilized. Sterilization is voluntary, but it is a prerequisite for remaining in the Reich. The sterilized "Mischling '' is then liberated from all the constricting ordinances to which he has heretofore been subjected.

2. Treatment of Mischlinge of the 2nd degree In principle, the Mischlinge of the 2nd degree will be treated as Germans, with the exception of the following cases

in which Mischlinge of the 2nd degree will be placed into the same position as Jews:

a) The descent of the Mischling of the 2nd degree from a bastard marriage (both parts Mischlinge).

b) Racially exceptionally poor appearance of the Misch ling of the 2nd degrée, so that for external reasons alone he has to be considered a Jew.

c) A particularly unfavorable appraisal from a police and political viewpoint which indicates that the Mischling of the 2nd degree feels and behaves like a Jew.

Even these considerations, however, should not apply if the Mischling of the 2nd degree is married to a German. 3. Marriages between full Jews and Germans

In individual cases, it must be decided whether the Jewish partner is to be evacuated or whether, considering the effect of such a measure on the German relatives, he is to be transferred to an old people's ghetto.

4. Marriages between Mischlinge of the 1st degree and Germans

a) Without children:

If there are no children, the Mischling of the 1st degree is to be evacuated, or transferred to an old people's ghetto (same treatment as in the case of marriages

between full Jews and Germans, point 3).

b) With children:

If there are children (Mischlinge of the 2nd degree) and they are placed into the same position as Jews, they will be evacuated along with the [parent who is al Mischling of the 1st degree, or transferred to a ghetto. Insofar as these children are placed into the same position as Germans (the regular case) they are to be exempted from evacuation, and so will [the parent who is a] Mischling of the 1st degree.

5. Marriages between Mischlinge of the 1st degree and Mischlinge of the 2nd degree or Jews

In the case of these marriages, all the elements (including the children) are to be treated as Jews and hence evacuated, or transferred to an old people's ghetto. 6. Marriages between Mischlinge of the 1st degree and Mischlinge of the 2nd degree

Both partners, without regard to children, are to be evacuated, or placed into an old people's ghetto, since racially the children, if any, regularly reveal a stronger Jewish blood component than do Mischlinge of the 2nd degree.

SS-Major General Hofmann is of the view that one will have to make widespread use of sterilization, especially since the Mischlinge, faced with the choice of being evacuated or sterilized, would rather submit to sterilization.

Undersecretary Dr. Stuckart [Interior Ministry} stated that in this form the practical implementation of the possibilities just mentioned for cleaning up the mixed marriage and mixed parentage problem would entail an endless administrative task. In order to be sure, however, of taking into account also the biological facts, Undersecretary Dr. Stuckart proposed to proceed with compulsory sterilization.

To simplify the Mischling problem, one should further think about the possibility of enabling the lawmaker to say in so many words: "These marriages are dissolved."

As for the effect of the evacuation of the Jews on economic life, Undersecretary Neumann [Four Year Plan] declared that at the moment Jews employed in important war work could not be evacuated until replacements became available.

SS-Lieutenant General Heydrich pointed to the fact that in accordance with directives authorized by him for current evacuations, these Jews were not being evacuated anyhow.

Undersecretary Dr. Bühler stated that the General Government [of Poland] would welcome the start of the final solution of this question in its territory, since the transport problem was no overriding factor there and the course of the action would not be hindered by considerations of work utilization. Jews should be removed from the domain of the General Government as fast as possible, because it is precisely here that the Jew constitutes a substantial danger as a carrier of epidemics and also because his continued black market activities create constant disorder in the economic structure of the country. Moreover, the majority of the

2½ million Jews involved were not capable of work.

Undersecretary Dr. Bühler stated further that the Chief of the Security Police and Security Service was in charge of the final solution of the Jewish question in the General Government and that his work was being supported by the offices of the General Government. He only had one favor to ask: that the Jewish question in this territory be solved as rapidly as possible.

Finally there was a discussion of the various types of solution possibilities, with both Gauleiter Dr. Meyer and Under secretary Dr. Bühler expressing the view that they could carry out certain preparatory measures in their territories on their own, provided, however, that any disturbance of the [non Jewish] population had to be avoided.

The conference was closed with a plea of the Chief of Security Police and Security Service for the cooperation of all the participants in the implementation of the solution tasks.
