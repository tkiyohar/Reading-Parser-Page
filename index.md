Modern History Sourcebook: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1900-89): The Uprising of Khurdad 15, 1979
 
Born Ruhollah Hendi, the Ayatollah (the word signifies religious leader) took the name in 1930. He taught in the major Shi'ite theological school at Qom, but was exiled for his opposition to the government of the Shah Living in Paris after 1978 he orchestrated the Islamic Revolution of 1979 in Iran. He became the effective political and religious leader of the country until his death in 1989.
 
Those who are ignorant must be guided to a correct understanding. We must say to them: "You who imagine that something can be achieved in Iran by some means other than Islam, you who suppose that something other than Islam overthrew the Shah's regime, you who believe non-Islamic elements played a role--study the matter carefully. Look at the tombstones of those who gave their lives in the movement of Khurdad 15. If you can find a single tombstone belonging to one of the non-Islamic elements, it will mean they played a role. And if, among the tombstones of the Islamic elements, you can find a single tombstone belonging to someone from the upper echelons of society, it will mean that they too played a role. But you will not find a single tombstone belonging to either of those groups. All the tombstones belong to Muslims from the lower echelons of society: peasants, workers, tradesmen, committed religious scholars. Those who imagine that some force other than Islam could shatter the great barrier of tyranny are mistaken. As for those who oppose us because of their opposition to Islam, we must cure them by means of guidance, if it is at all possible; otherwise, we will destroy these agents of foreign powers with the same fist that destroyed the Shah's regime.
 
Your opponents, oppressed people, have never suffered. In the time of the taghut, they never suffered because either they were in agreement with the regime and loyal to it, or they kept silent. Now you have spread the banquet of freedom in front of them and they have sat down to eat. Xenomaniacs, people infatuated with the West, empty people, people with no content! Come to your senses; do not try to westernize everything you have! Look at the West, and see who the people are in the West that present themselves as champions of human rights and what their aims are. Is it human rights they really care about, or the rights of the superpowers? What they really want to secure are the rights of the superpowers. Our jurists should not follow or imitate them. You should implement human rights as the working classes of our society understand them. Yes, they are the real Society for the Defense of Human Rights. They are the ones who secure the well-being of humanity; they work while you talk; for they are Muslims and Islam cares about humanity. You who have chosen a course other than Islam--you do nothing for humanity. All you do is write and speak in an effort to divert our movement from its course.
 
But as for those who want to divert our movement from its course, who have in mind treachery against Islam and the nation, who consider Islam incapable of running the affairs of our country despite its record of 1400 years---they have nothing at all to do with our people, and this must be made clear. How much you talk about the West, claiming that we must measure Islam in accordance with Western criteria! What an error! It was the mosques that created this Revolution, the mosques that brought this movement into being. The mihrab was a place not only for preaching, but also for war--war against both the devil within and the tyrannical powers without. So preserve your mosques, O people. Intellectuals, do not be Western-style intellectuals, imported intellectuals; do your share to preserve the mosques!

AN EMERGING CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS?
 
The phrase "clash of civilizations'' came into currency early in the 1990s after Samuel P. Huntington, a senior Harvard professor of government, published an essay with that title in Foreign Affairs.' Huntington disagreed with the dominant view, occasioned by the end of the Cold War, that the world had entered an era of international harmony, and he doubted the emerging conventional wisdom that global economic forces would draw countries together. He saw instead deep, fundamental fault lines dividing peoples and countries around the world into distinct, competing civilizations defined by divergent cultural values. His essay emphasized the West's unique qualities (above all, democracy and liberalism) and its obligation to protect its values in a struggle between (to use the phrase that he invoked) "the West and the Rest." Huntington nominated the United States as the leader of the West with a special responsibility to protect Western values, especially in the face of resurgent Asian/ Confucian states, chiefly China, and strong Islamic currents running through a wide swath of territory running from North Africa eastward.
 
In the wake of its publication, the Huntington thesis gained support from the outbreak of civil wars and ethnic quarrels in Bosnia and Rwanda, from failed democratic initiatives, and from proliferating weapons of mass destruction. The post-Cold War order did indeed seem as conflict prone as any earlier time. After the September 11 attacks on the United States and the initia tion of an international war on terrorism, Huntington looked to many like a prophet providing a key to the understanding of such pressing Middle East issues as Israel's occupation of Palestinian land, Iraq under U.S.-British tute lage, the clerical regime in Iran, and foreign control of regional oil. The region did indeed look like it had become the focus of the clash of civilizations.
 
Huntington's critics pointed to historical complexities and social problems that his argument ignored. In particular, they contended that the widen ing appeal of political Islam over the last several decades was the result of specific grievances and aspirations that differed from place to place, not the expression of some cosmic civilizational force. The resulting debate raised the question of whether globalization was going to create a culturally uniform world, was it giving rise to tensions, or was it proving a relatively weak force vulnerable to local challenge or malleable into regional forms of modernity.
 
Osama bin Laden Blames the "Western Crusaders"
 
10.4
 
Osama bin Laden, founder and leader of the organization known as Al Qaeda (literally "the base"), was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1957. His father was of Yemeni origins but moved to Saudi Arabia where he operated a construction business. The father's pride in his work on holy sites in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and in East Jerusalem suggests the atmosphere of piety in which bin Laden was raised. At university he studied economics before going to work for his father's company. When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, bin Laden organized Al Qaeda to help Muslim volunteers to join the resistance. Hardly had the last Soviet troops departed in 1989 then the Americans began setting up military bases in their home land as part of the first Gulf War. This intrusion into the land of Islam's most holy shrines sharpened bin Laden's alienation from the Saudi ruling family and hostility toward the United States. Al Qaeda launched a series of bombings directed at U.S. embassies, ships, and barracks, capped by the attacks on New York and Washing ton in 2001.
 
Who or what does bin Laden see as the main threat to the region and to Muslims? Does his statement serve to support the Huntington thesis? How do the views articulated here compare to those of Khomeini and Hamas treated earlier? To extend the comparison: Is bin Laden a reincarnation of the third-world radicals of the 1960s (treated in chapter 6)?
 
Al-Jazeera Television Interview
 
December 1998)
 
We demand that our land be liberated from enemies. That our lands be liberated from the Americans....
 
Our enemies roam and meander in our seas and lands and skies, attack and assault without seeking permission from anyone.... The present [Arab] regimes no longer have the power. Either they are collaborators or have lost the power to do anything against this contemptible occupation. So Muslims should immigrate somewhere where they can raise the symbol of jihad [struggle] and protect their religion and world, otherwise they will lose everything. Are they incapable of appreciating the calamity that befell our brothers in Palestine and forgetting how the Palestinian people... have become a refugee people, turned into slaves of those colonialist Jews who dictate their movements? The situation is dangerous and if we do not move now, when the ancient holy site of 1.2 billion Muslims has been usurped, then when should people stir? Those who believe that such attacks Jagainst Iraq] will terrorize the Islamic move ments are deluding themselves. We Muslims believe that our time of death is fixed. Our fortunes are in the hand of God.
 
[Elvery American man is an enemy of ours whether he fights us directly or merely pays his taxes. You might have heard those who supported Clinton's [air] attacks against Iraq formed three-quarters of the American population. A people that regards its president in high favor when he kills innocent people is a decadent people with no understanding of morality..
 
We are seeking to drive them [the Americans] out of our Islamic nations and prevent them from dominating us. We believe that this right to defend oneself is the right of all human beings. At a time when Israel stocks hundreds of nuclear warheads and when the Western crusaders control a large percentage of this type of] weapon, we do not consider this an accusation but a right. We congratulated the Pakistani people when they achieved this nuclear weapon, and we consider it the right of all Muslims to do so....
 
Those Muslims who say that these are not the times for jilting are gravely wrong. Following the absence of jihad from our umma world community of Muslims] for such a long time, we acquired a generation of people seeking education who had not experienced the reality of jihad, and they have been influenced by the American culture and media invasion that stormed the Muslim countries. Without even participating in a military war, we find this generation has already been psychologically beaten. What is true is that God granted the chance of jihad in Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Bosnia, and we are assured that we can wage a jihad against the enemies of Islam, in particular against the greater external enemy- the crusader-Jewish alliance. Those who carried out the jihad (against Soviet forces] in Afghanistan did more than was expected of them because with very meager capacities they destroyed the largest military force and in doing so removed from our minds this notion of stronger nations. We believe that America is weaker than Russia, and from what we have heard from our brothers who waged jihad in Somalia, they found to their greatest surprise the weakness, frailty, and cowardliness of the American soldier. When only eight of them were killed[.] they packed up in the darkness of night and escaped without looking back.
 
[This is our aim to liberate the lands of Islam from the sinners. America and some of its agents in the region bargained with me more than ten times to keep quiet and silence this small tongue of mine. "Shut up" and we will return your money to you. They believe that people only live for worldly matters, and they forget that our lives are meaningless if we do not seek to please the goodwill and pleasure of Allah.
 
Finally, I advise all Muslims to adhere to the Koran. This is the way out from our present predicament. Our cure is the Koran. When one reads the Koran one wonders: Do they not read the Koran, or do they actually read but not understand as they should?

Edward Said Rejects the Clash Thesis and the Call to Jihad
 
When Huntington's views gained a new lease on life after September 11, Edward Said, a literature specialist at Columbia University, had perhaps the best reason of any of the critics to respond. Born into a Palestinian family driven into exile by Israeli expansion, his roots were in the region. He was an outspoken supporter of the Palestinian cause as well as an influential writer on the biases that Americans and Europeans had carried to the region across several centuries and that were still evident in Huntington's perspective. While Americans might see themselves as different, they were in fact deeply implicated in what Said called "orientalism," the persistent and largely unconscious pattern of Western stereotyping and demeaning of the peoples and cultures of the Middle East. Finally, Said had long fought intellectual battles with one of Huntington's main sources on the Middle East. Bernard Lewis, a historian at Princeton.
 
How does Said seek to undercut the emphasis on civilizational conflict? What sort of policy does he seem to suggest as a substitute for the 'war on terror"? How might Huntington have responded to Said's argument? In the final analysis who is more compelling - Huntington or Said? Imagine an exchange between bin Laden and Said: Is the gap between those two as great as between Said and Huntington?
 
"The Clash of Ignorance" October 2001
 
[In Huntington's argument] the personification of enormous entities called "the West" and "Islam" is recklessly affirmed, as if hugely complicated matters like identity and culture existed in a cartoonlike world where Popeye and Bluto bash each other mercilessly, with one always more virtuous pugilist getting the upper hand over his adversary. Certainly neither Huntington nor [Bernard] Lewis has much time to spare for the internal dynamics and plurality of every civilization, or for the fact that the major contest in most modern cultures concerns the definition or interpretation of each culture, or for the unattractive possibility that a great deal of demagogy and downright ignorance is involved in pursuing to speak for a whole religion or civilization. No, the West is the West, and Islam Islam.
 
... In fact, Huntington is an ideologist, someone who wants to make "civilizations" and "identities" into what they are not: shut-down, sealed-off entities that have been purged of the myriad currents and countercurrents that animate human history, and that over centuries have made it possible for that history not only to contain wars of religion and imperial conquest but also to be one of exchange, cross-fertilization and sharing. This far less visible history is ignored in the rush to highlight the ludicrously compressed and constricted warfare that "the clash of civilizations" argues is the reality..
 
The basic paradigm of West versus the rest (the cold war opposition reformulated) remained untouched, and this is what has persisted, often insidiously and implicitly, in discussion since the terrible events of September 11. The carefully planned and horrendous, pathologically motivated suicide at tack and mass slaughter by a small group of deranged militants has been turned into proof of Huntington's thesis....
 
But why not instead see parallels, admittedly less spectacular in their destructiveness, for Osama bin Laden and his followers in cults like the Branch Davidians or the disciples of the Rev. Jim Jones at Guyana or the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo?.... Uncountable are the editorials in every American and European newspaper and magazine of note adding to this vocabulary of gigantism and apocalypse, each use of which is plainly designed not to edify but to inflame the reader's indignant passion as a member of the "West," and what we need to do. Churchillian rhetoric is used inappropriately by self-appointed combat ants in the West's, and especially America's, war against its haters, despoilers, destroyers, with scant attention to complex histories that defy such reductiveness and have seeped from one territory into another, in the process overriding the boundaries that are supposed to separate us all into divided armed camps. This is the problem with unedifying labels like Islam and the West: They mislead and confuse the mind, which is trying to make sense of a disorderly reality that won't be pigeonholed or strapped down as easily as all that. I remember interrupting a man who, after a lecture I had given at a West Bank university in 1994, rose from the audience and started to attack my ideas as "Western," as opposed to the strict Islamic ones he espoused. "Why are you wearing a suit and tie?" was the first retort that came to mind. "They're West ern too." He sat down with an embarrassed smile on his face, but I recalled the incident when information on the September 11 terrorists started to come in: how they had mastered all the technical details required to inflict their homicidal evil on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the aircraft they had commandeered. Where does one draw the line between "Western" tech nology and, as [Italy's prime minister Silvio] Berlusconi declared, "Islam's" inability to be a part of "modernity"?
 
One cannot easily do so, of course. How finally inadequate are the labels, generalizations and cultural assertions. At some level, for instance, primitive passions and sophisticated know-how converge in ways that give the lie to a fortified boundary not only between "West" and "Islam" but also between past and present, us and them, to say nothing of the very concepts of identity and nationality about which there is unending disagreement and debate. A unilateral decision made to draw lines in the sand, to undertake crusades, to oppose their evil with our good, to extirpate terrorism and, in Paul Wolfowitz's' nihilistic vocabulary, to end nations entirely, doesn't make the supposed enti ties any easier to see; rather, it speaks to how much simpler it is to make bellicose statements for the purpose of mobilizing collective passions than to reflect, examine, sort out what it is we are dealing with in reality, the interconnectedness of innumerable lives, "ours" as well as "theirs."
 
In a remarkable series of three articles published between January and March 1999 in Dawn, Pakistan's most respected weekly, the late Eqbal Ahmad, writing for a Muslim audience, analyzed what he called the roots of the reli gious right, coming down very harshly on the mutilations of Islam by abso lutists and fanatical tyrants whose obsession with regulating personal behavior promotes "an Islamic order reduced to a penal code, stripped of its hu manism, aesthetics, intellectual quests, and spiritual devotion." The modern Islamists, Ahmad concludes, are "concerned with power, not with the soul; with the mobilization of people for political purposes rather than with sharing and alleviating their sufferings and aspirations. Theirs is a very limited and time-bound political agenda." What has made matters worse is that similar distortions and zealotry occur in the "Jewish" and "Christian" universes of discourse....
 
...Think of the populations today of France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Brit ain, America, even Sweden, and you must concede that Islam is no longer on the fringes of the West but at its center. But what is so threatening about that presence? Buried in the collective culture are memories of the first great Arab-Islamic conquests, which began in the seventh century and which shattered once and for all the ancient unity of the Mediterranean, destroyed the Christian-Roman synthesis and gave rise to a new civilization dominated by northern powers (Germany and Carolingian France) whose mission... is to resume defense of the "West" against its historical-cultural enemies.... [I]n the creation of this new line of defense the West drew on humanism. science, philosophy, sociology and historiography of Islam, which had already interposed itself between Charlemagne's world and classical antiquity. Islam is inside from the start, as even Dante, great enemy of Mohammed, had to con cede when he placed the Prophet at the very heart of his Inferno..
 
...These are tense times, but it is better to think in terms of powerful and powerless communities, the secular politics of reason and ignorance, and universal principles of justice and injustice, than to wander off in search of vast abstractions that may give momentary satisfaction but little self-knowledge or informed analysis. "The Clash of Civilizations' ' thesis is a gimmick better for reinforcing defensive self-pride than for critical understanding of the bewildering interdependence of our time.

The Future of the New "We"
 
Muslims in the West to Western Muslims
 
BY TARIQ RAMADAN
 
August 20, 2013
 
This is a discussion of the relationship between Muslims, Islam, and the West. There is an increasing need for both Muslims and people of other faiths (or with no faith) of the West to change the way they perceive Islam. Moving away from the first immigrants generations ago, Muslims are now fully-entitled contributors to Western societies and will remain so in the future. Islam is no longer a foreign religion to the West, and discourse surrounding it should not be solely about immigrants, as if Muslims are foreigners rather than residents and citizens. I propose that the way forward is to jettison the time-worn dialogue of "them and us" which generates its own set of challenges, and instead for each of us to accept our diversity as an asset and consider our shared future together a shared responsibility towards the new "We."
 
Millions of Western citizens are Muslims. Today and for the future, Islam is a Western religion and an irrefutable part of Western identity. This is critical to acknowledge because persistent dialogue about Muslims as immigrants or citizens with immigrant backgrounds perpetuates a distinction between two different entities. However, this is an erroneous understanding of the current situation. Muslims have been living in some Western countries for decades, with fourth and fifth generations of Muslim citizens now being born into these countries.
 
Western society as a whole faces two key challenges in fostering coexistence and allowing all groups to be able to contribute to a better future and have a common narrative. The first relates to Western realities, where it is critical to recognize that the West is dealing with a number of different crises. By acknowledging this, we will begin to understand that Islam is often used as a diversion from some of the true problems. One such example is the identity crisis that the West is now experiencing, created by the contradiction between economic needs and cultural resistance. Immigrants make up a vital part of the workforce in the West, and their presence is an indispensable need, yet at the same time, there is a discourse highlighting tensions between national identity and the entry of new immigrants. The West lacks confidence and vision as to its own future in economic, political, and cultural terms.
 
Nonetheless, these problems are not justifications for Muslims to ignore their own internal challenges. Islam is a tremendously heterogeneous religion, with Muslims coming from a diversity of cultures, nations, and ethnicities. Muslims have a responsibility to be faithful to their religious principles and to fully and actively participate in their home Western societies while being confident that the flexibility of the Islamic legal principles and the latitude of laws within Western countries are compatible. To be fully and actively participating citizens, Muslims need to nurture a sense of attachment, belonging, respect, pride, and loyalty in "my country," a feeling that this is "my home" as well as "my children's future." With all the recurrent confusion and misinterpretation both within and surrounding Islam, this can sometimes be a demanding undertaking.
 
The West: The Challenges of a Pluralistic Society
 
The discourse in the West of multiculturalism, identity, and integration makes it clear that we are facing an identity crisis as to who we are going to be. Some have the perception that the new "global" world is undermining our individual sense of belonging to one nation. Citizens' loyalties are now scattered, and immigrants have their own, seemingly robust, visibility. This new visibility, mainly that of Muslims whose ancestry is from countries in the Southern hemisphere, is disturbing the very essence of what has been perceived for years as a neutral public sphere. This new cultural and religious presence challenges our societies' once-homogeneous identity. Immigration has evolved into an issue that has become associated with, or used as a sole explanation for, the socioeconomic problems that all our societies are currently facing. Our education systems are in crisis; there are problems concerning social justice, poverty, unemployment, marginalization, corruption, and crime. All these socioeconomic problems can become mixed up with the issue of immigration and the presence of a perceived "other" to create a new kind of populist, unconstructive discourse.
 
The characteristics of populism include the promotion of very simplistic answers to complex problems by targeting a guilty presence. For example, in my home country of Switzerland, it used to focus on the Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. Today, this guilty presence throughout the West centers on "Muslims" as a transnational reality. The second characteristic of populism is the nurturing of a sense of fear and phobia by insinuating that our country is under siege, inciting anxiety associated with the diminution of the identity of our nation, and suggesting that "others" are silently colonizing us. The new Islamophobia has some common characteristics with the old anti-Semitism and Judeophobia: social fears are fostered by a discourse that targets the "other" as being responsible for all problems, because it is easier to target specific communities or minorities than to seek genuine political or economic solutions. The third characteristic of populism is to cultivate a victim mentality to say that we are not responsible for the current situation, because "they" are the perpetrator, and "we" are the victims.
 
The consequence of all three characteristics is the fourth feature of binary vision, an "us versus them" attitude. This perception very much exists within our Western society-populist discourse and emotional politics thrive on simplistic answers and a lack of in-depth solutions to complex socio economic and political problems. In emotional politics where discourse is centered on that which is visible, emotional, and controversial, the reactions that are generated create rejection rather than a civic sense of belonging. People who were once considered as individual groups of Pakistanis, Turkish, Egyptians, Tunisians, Algerians, Africans, Malians, etc. are now bracketed altogether as Muslims. This is a transnational phenomenon which nurtures a sense of fear. We can see this happening in France, Germany, Canada, and the United States all throughout the West, where people are now targeted as Muslims.
 
The first immigrants who came to work, settle, and become citizens were asked to abide by the law, and as a consequence were welcomed as part of, and contributors to, their new society. This was an appropriate first step. The problem today is that whilst these people might be citizens with, in theory, the same rights, they still do not belong to the common narrative of the nation. They are citizens by law and yet still alien to the nation's narrative: citizens of the State, foreigners within the Nation. The entire narrative of their nation ignores their presence as part of the past, part of the present, and a necessary positive part of the future. The West has to face this reality because the resultant discourse of populism is nurturing a perpetual sense that Islam is the other that all Muslims are foreigners that do not have the same culture, same civilization, or same understanding of values or principles.
 
Islam: The Challenges from Within
 
Muslims are also facing problems internally, and as I summarize in my book, What I Believe, we are witnessing a silent revolution within Islam today. The first stages of settlement in the West, particularly in Europe and Australia, were quite difficult for Muslims: they faced a tension between their cultures of origin and Islamic principles. It was as if the Islamic principles were so rooted in the cultures of origin that it was difficult to differentiate between the two. But it is critical to acknowledge that religion and culture are not the same. There is no religion without culture and there are no cultures without religion, but religion is not culture. So for Muslims, according to both the Islamic legal tradition and jurists, whilst the Islamic principles are immutable (the creed, six pillars of faith, the five pillars of practice-praying, fasting, prohibitions, etc.) and must be respected wherever we are, factors such as the way we dress, what we eat, and our way of life can be flexible and are guided by our culture, not our religion. When we settle in a new culture we even need to reassess the way the scriptural sources are read: for example, in terms of the changing relationship between social classes or between men and women, new cultures are pushing Muslims to reassess historical readings and understandings. It might be that some practices that are perceived as Islamic are in fact more cultural than religious.
 
It is critical for Muslims to acknowledge this cultural projection and to able to adjust and correct such practices so that they are more truthful to the principles of Islam. These were the steps that the first Muslim immigrants undertook, and indeed we continue to strive to resolve these issues today. Many new answers and new visions have been promoted, and these remain rooted in tradition: faithful to scriptural sources but new in their understanding and interpretation. This renewal, tajdeed, is not a new concept, and has been an important part of the Islamic dynamic since the beginning. We are not changing the scriptural texts, but the way the texts are read. Time and space is shifting and this has to be acknowledged. This is the first challenge for Muslims, and it is a work in progress. As it is coming from scholars and Western Muslims, I call it the "silent revolution," an intellectual revolution and the birth of a new mindset.
 
The second challenge of equal consequence is to accept and respect the diversity within Islam. There are many trends within Islam and among Western Muslims and such diversity can cause tension and division. There is tension, both in the Middle East and the West, between the two Islamic traditions of Shi'a and Sunni Muslims. Added to this, we can identify many trends: for example, Salafi literalists isolate themselves from the surrounding society. Sufis strive not to be publicly visible Muslims, but rather practice their faith privately, and may not even be known as practicing Muslims. Reformists acknowledge their environment, wanting to be involved in their society and promote a new understanding of the rules, faithful to the principles but adapting and acknowledging their environment (see my proposed categorization in Western Muslims and the Future of Islam). Muslims are experiencing two further diversities specifically relating to social class and political positioning which in turn leads to further complexities. In the United States for example, African-American Muslims from more challenging, inner city backgrounds are often confronted with racism. While some Muslim immigrants are settling well and experiencing the "American dream", second, third, and fourth generation US-born, African-American Muslims challenge the myth of this so-called land of opportunity and equality. Some African-American Muslims continue to experience unemployment, lack of recognition, racism, and discrimination this is no American dream. Yet these Muslims are not migrants, they are as indigenous as most white Americans (lest we forget the true native Americans). This same social class divide exists in Europe, Canada and Australia. Added to this is political positioning, with some people viewing themselves as more left- or right-wing on the political spectrum.
 
These are added divisions that complicate the religious positioning of Muslims and could contribute to the division of Islamic populations in the West. Muslims are experiencing tensions and divisions and it is critical to acknowledge this as part of Muslim reality in the West in order to be able to move forward.
 
I have been advocating for Muslims to acknowledge the three L's: the first is to respect and abide by the law of your country, provided that the two principles of respecting freedom of conscience and freedom of worship are present (which is the case in all the Western countries, at least in legal theory). There is flexibility within Islamic legislation, and together with the latitude of Western legislation it is possible to find a path that is at the same time law-abiding and faithful to our religious principles. To facilitate this, we need a secular legal framework that is implemented equally for all citizens, including Muslims.
 
The second important consideration is language. Citizenship means power, duties and rights, and you cannot be a true citizen without a good command of the country's national language. Language should be promoted through education. Whilst Arabic is useful to be able to read scriptural sources, it is important to learn and be comfortable with the language of your country or your nation to be able to be involved, to participate, and to be a witness. I call the West, as well as the globalized world, Dar Shahada, which means "abode of witness," where you are visible with your values, your behavior, your engagement within society, and your commitment: language is a critical factor and facilitator for this. Loyalty is the third consideration, where loyalty is not only connected to the state. This loyalty means, as I mentioned above, that we feel part of the nation in which we live with a sense of belonging. We are involved in society as citizens. However, loyalty is not blind support to the nation, and it is not a statement that "you are with us or against us." This loyalty must always be a critical loyalty: to be with my nation is to be critical of my government when I think, as a citizen, that my government is doing wrong. Critical loyalty is the only true loyalty.
 
Guided by these 3 L's, Muslims can achieve better understanding of and involvement in their societies. Throughout all Western countries, Muslim women and men are now actively involved in this process. They accept the law of their country, they are learning their country's European language to the same standard as their fellow citizens, and at the same time they are nurturing a sense of loyalty.
 
Integration will be successful when we stop talking about integration, and instead replace all reference to it with contribution. Contribution is to have a positive, creative presence. As well as cultivating that feeling of belonging to your nation and the common narrative (by taking time to absorb your country's past and history), one should also be creative in cultural terms, with the arts, entertainment, poetry, literature, sciences, and education. Western Muslims have the means to be more creative. We are less creative when we try to protect ourselves from an environment that we understand as being hostile, so Muslims can relax and acknowledge they are Western by culture.
 
A Shared Responsibility
 
This will be a long, evolving process. I think we will need at least two generations to see the effects of the new creative contribution of Muslims. This creativity is already present in sport, culture, journalism, and media, but further contribution is needed in the arts, education, sciences, and social dynamics. Yet this can only be achieved with the understanding that there is a shared responsibility. If Western discourse continues to portray Islam and Muslims as the alien factor and continues to be driven by populism and the "us versus them" mentality, we will not see improvements. Positive progress will come only when we all accept that we are living together and that this situation is not going to go away.
 
This shared responsibility is a prerequisite for the new "we," or nation, societies, and narratives belonging to us all. Every citizen and every tradition can make a positive contribution; pluralism is an asset but it takes time, effort, and intellectual humility to understand that whatever your culture, tradition, or memory, you still need others to enrich you and help you to make the best contribution possible to your world. Acknowledging the contribution of the other and that their presence can be positive, that we all have room to learn more and need to open up in order to live together, is the only way to achieve a deep sense of what it means to be a humanist advocating respectful pluralism. Living together does not mean that we should forget ourselves; rather, it is about being true to ourselves and our principles while maintaining positive interaction with those who are different. We may have different paths and have different religions, but we surely have a common future.
