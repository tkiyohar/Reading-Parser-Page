THE STATE AND THE FREE MARKET
 
During the 1930s and early 1940s some of the great minds of western Europe turned to the troubled problem of the relationship between the state and the economy. The political and economic turmoil of the 1930s helped thrust this issue to the top of the intellectual agenda. The Great Depression had brought widespread misery and thrown into doubt the idea of the free market as a self-righting mechanism. Rather than bouncing back after the initial crisis, production continued to stagnate and unemployment remained high. The resulting populist discontents made national socialism possible in Germany and Italy. In both places the state stepped in to soften the hard edges of suffering Though bound for defeat by 1944-1945, Germany and Italy remained a reminder that economic hardship could drive hard-pressed populations to embrace authoritarian regimes. An additional consideration was the apparent success of the socialist experiment in the Soviet Union. Central planning and control had catapulted the USSR into the front ranks of the economic powers, and the socialist emphasis on state planning and ownership of industry enjoyed high prestige. Finally, the prospect of rebuilding Europe's economics from the ground up after World War II fueled debate about the practical as well as the moral and political advantages of various economic models. In the following documents, the term laissez-faire figures in a central way.
 
Whatever their attitude toward it, those involved in this great economic debate understood the term to mean an economic system in which the free market should function with only the most minimal state intervention. For them laissez-faire and liberal were roughly equivalent terms, in stark contrast to the more recent association of liberal with big government managing a wide range of social programs and taxing heavily to pay for those programs. In this older sense the liberal was the defender of individual economic and political rights, while in the more recent meaning liberals seek to address social needs and values that transcend the individual.

John Maynard Keynes on State Intervention in the Economy
 
John Maynard Keynes was the best-known proponent of state intervention to make the free market function more efficiently. He was also a prolific author, trusted government adviser, and devotee of the arts, good food, and stimulating conversation. Born in 1883 and educated at Cambridge, he made that British university town and London his home during an intensely engaged professional career. During the Great Depression, his chief concern was why markets did not spring back as classic economic theory said they were supposed to do as part of a natural self-correcting mechanism. Keynes's findings on this point made him one of the most influential economists of the mid-twentieth century. His death came in 1946 just as his ideas were becoming orthodoxy worldwide.
 
Keynes, as the first to speak in this debate over the postwar economy, can help us grasp what the main issues were. What weaknesses did he find in the free market or laissez-faire ideal? How in turn do those weaknesses justify state intervention in the economy? What in Keynes's thinking were the limits of state intervention? How did the Soviet German and Italian record of state intervention in the economy during the 1930s influence his thinking
 
From The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes
 
1924 and 1932
 
ON THE INADEQUACY OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES (1924) It was the economists who gave the notion of laissez-faire or governmental non-interference in the economy] a good scientific basis. Suppose that by the working of natural laws individuals pursuing their own interests with enlightenment in conditions of freedom always tend to promote the general interest at the same time! Our philosophical difficulties are resolved-at least for the practical man, who can then concentrate his efforts on securing the necessary conditions of freedom. To the philosophical doctrine that the government has no right to interfere, and the divine that it has no need to interfere, there is added scientific proof offered by the economists] that its interference is inexpedient. This is the third current of thought, just discoverable in Adam Smith, who was ready in the main to allow the public good to rest on "the natural effort of every individual to better his own condition"
 
Laissez-faire is a method of bringing the most successful profit makers to the top by a ruthless struggle for survival, which selects the most efficient by the bankruptcy of the less efficient. It does not count the cost of the struggle, but looks only to the benefits of the final result which are assumed to be permanent....
 
Let us clear from the ground the metaphysical or general principles upon which, from time to time, laissez-faire has been founded. It is not true that individuals possess a prescriptive 'natural liberty' in their economic activities. There is no 'compact conferring perpetual rights on those who Have or on those who Acquire. The world is not so governed from above that private and social interests always coincide. It is not so managed here below that in practice they coincide. It is not a correct deduction from the principles of economics that enlightened self-interest always operates in the public interest. Nor is it true that self-interest generally is enlightened; more often individuals acting separately to promote their own ends are too ignorant or too weak to attain even these. Experience does not show that individuals, when they make up a social unit, are always less clear-sighted than when they act separately....
 
ON THE VIRTUES OF STATT PLANNING (1932)
 
There is a new conception in the air today- a new conception of the possible functions of government...
 
It is called planning-state planning.... We can accept the desirability and even the necessity of planning without being a Communist, a Socialist or a Fascist. But whether it is going to prove possible to carry out planning in actual practice without a great change in the traditions and in the machinery of democratic government that is the big question mark....
 
The forces which are driving the notion of planning into our heads are drawn from two distinct sources. The first is the force of example.The Russian Five-Year Plan has assaulted and captured the imagination of the world. This dream is not yet a realized success-it is much too soon to say that - but it is not the preposterous failure which many wise and experienced people expected it to be. We are now as a reaction from our mistake - much more inclined, I think, to exaggerate its success than to underestimate it... We had been taught to think of Communism as involving so complete a destruction of human organization, that when we learned that, after enormous sufferings and an incredible national effort of self-denial and the exercise of will, a Russian peasant can positively build a tractor of which the wheels go round and that there is a large electric power station at Leningrad, we gape with wonder and rush to the opposite conclusion that Communism is a roaring success.
 
And there is a second force of example- Italian Fascism which-attacking the same problem with an opposite mentality-seems to have saved Italy from chaos and to have established a modest level of material prosperity within a poor and over-populated country. Here again, when an Englishman learns that an Italian train has run to time, he gapes with wonder and is ready to accept the conclusion that Fascism is a roaring success....
 
Nevertheless let us not belittle these magnificent experiments or refuse to learn from them. For it is a remarkable and a significant thing that the two most extraordinary political movements of the modern age, approaching their task from opposite moral and emotional poles, should agree in this vital particular that state planning, that intelligence and deliberation at the center must supersede the admired disorder of the 19th century.
 
...There is also the failure of the unplanned economic systems of the world, of those where intelligent deliberation at the center is minimized or rejected. Not indeed a relative failure; for England or the United States with a quarter of the population and a third of the productive plant at a standstill can nevertheless support a standard of life at least twice as high, I should suppose, as any existing Bolshevist or even Fascist state. But an absolute failure in relation to their own potentialities. That is what demands our attention.
 
For what are the economic events of the modern world which must most strike the apprehension of the dullest observer? The extraordinary capacity for the production of material wealth-though it were for the purposes of subsequent destruction which we developed during World War I]; and the opposite picture today of starvation amidst plenty, our incredible inability to carry to our mouths the nourishment which we have produced with our hands. For the War was the nearest thing we have ever had in this country to a planned regime. The environment was unfavorable, the haste was excessive and hurried improvisations were inevitable. Yet it showed us the potentialities of modern technique to produce. On the other hand today it is in the United States, where the national tradition is most antagonistic to the notion of planning and the forms of government least adapted to improvised planning, that the failure of the economic system, relative to its opportunity, is most obvious.
 
To remedy this failure is the problem of planning. (The essence of state planning lis] to do those things which in the nature of the case are outside the scope of the individual. It differs from Socialism and from Communism in that it does not seek to aggrandise the province of the state for its own sake. It does not aim at superseding the individual within the field of operations appropriate to the individual, or of transforming the wage system, or of abolishing the profit motive. Its object is to take hold of the central controls and to govern them with deliberate foresight and thus modify and condition the environment within which the individual freely operates with and against other individuals.
 
The distribution of the burden of taxation with a view to its effect on industry and on the divisions of incomes and of wealth is an example of state planning Tariffs can be a signal and outstanding example of planning.. So is the regulation of transport by road and by rail.
 
But at such a time as the present the most outstanding opportunity for state planning throughout the world is to be found in the avoidance, or in the mitigation of industrial slumps during which there is so vast a loss of the world's potentialities for the creation of wealth. Here again we have a problem which lies completely outside the scope of the individual. There is virtually nothing that he can do, however ardent his desire and however pressing his personal interest. He is alone, together with all his fellows, on a flood which he cannot control directly. And nothing can be of the least avail which does not come from concerted action at the center..
 
1State planning will lead us I believe too far more deliberate and far-reaching policies of credit control, to a great preoccupation with the appropriate level of the rate of interest, and in general to an attempt to control the rate at which new investment is encouraged and facilitated to take place.It used to be believed that the level of interest and the rate of investment were self-regulatory, and needed no management and no planning; and that all would be for the best if natural forces were left to discover and establish the inner harmonies. But such a view does not square with the facts of experience. As I began by saying, it is the failure of the unplanned industrial world of Western Europe and America to regulate itself to the best advantage, or to reap the fruits of the genius of its scientists and its engineers and its business organizers, which is predisposing many persons to consider without prejudice those far-reaching experimental projects of the most constructive minds of the post-war world which go, conveniently, by the name of planning
 
But is it practicable in a democratic community? May it not be a necessary price to pay for the benefits of state planning, that we also suffer those other affronts to the individual which seem to be inseparable from a Bolshevist or a Fascist state? For myself, I do not see why this needs to be so. At least I should like to try whether it is not possible to enjoy the advantages of both worlds.
 
Moreover, it should prove compatible with democratic and parliamentary government to introduce modern improvements and new organs of administration. State planning, as I conceive it, would not be administered or supervised in detail by democratically elected bodies. The latter would be judges, not of first, but of final instance, reserve forces to effect a change when grave mistakes had been made. The day-to-day tasks of state planning would be carried out in the same sort of way and with the same kind of instruments of administration under a democratic government, as they would be under an autocratic government..

Social Responsibility for Individual Welfare
 
I am happy that in this remarkable conference that has been called to celebrate and to deepen the thinking and knowledge of our people throughout the country on these subjects, we should have the stress laid on this particular subject: "Social Responsibility for Individual Welfare."
 
Every woman is proud that the first woman to be in the Cabinet to head a Department of Social Welfare is Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby, and we know that she will have the backing of the women of this country in every struggle to really bring to the people of the country a greater sense of welfare and opportunity and justice in the life of our land.
 
Now, it has come about that when you talk about the welfare state, as a rule people think that that is a rather derogatory term-that a welfare state is somehow not a good thing. But if we could just change it around a little and say that we believed that society included the government, the individuals themselves as individuals, and all other groups-universities, the people who form the policies, the industrialists, the people who guide commerce, industry, and agriculture-if we thought of them altogether as working together to increase the welfare of the individual, then we would cease, I think, to have fear of just the mere words "a welfare state." We would have a truer conception of what the words really mean.
 
It is basic in a democracy that leadership for the welfare of the people as a whole must come from the government. It is true that we pride ourselves on holding the reins of government, but we need leadership. We need a voice to define our cairns, to put into words the things we want to achieve; and so we look to the government to do just that-so that we do not stand still but move forward. Just as Alice in Wonderland had to run very fast to stay in the same place, we must run even faster to stay in the same place, and we have to do even more in order to go forward. We will go backward unless we go forward.
 
My husband used to say that we progressed through crises, that when the crisis was so bad that we wondered how we were going to meet it, then we were ready to try something new, to try something that perhaps we would otherwise have hesitated to undertake.
 
When sometimes I hear it said that in my husband's time we started something dreadful, something which they called "creeping socialism," I wonder whether instead we didn't really face the fact that a democracy must meet the needs of its people, and whether what we did was not actually to save democracy, to save free enterprise, to keep for ourselves as much freedom as we possibly could. Had we not met the needs of the people, we might have woken up and found ourselves not just in creeping socialism, but perhaps going actually to the far extremes of either fascism or communism, because we could not find a way to meet the needs of the people.
 
As I have been around the world it has seemed to me that we in this country, when we talk of capitalism or free enterprise, should explain what we mean, because there are many areas of the world in which it is not at all understood what we actually mean when we talk of our own capitalism, of our own development in the past thirty years or forty years, let us say.
 
We have had great changes, but they have been the changes which had to come if our people were to have a chance for full development. To be sure, some of the things were very new; now they seem very old. I can remember when we started old-age pensions. Now the idea is not very shocking to us-a mutual contribution towards this security in old age. We started to care for the blind and the crippled. Many said that it was simply a humanitarian gesture, but it was more than that. It is real insurance so that they will not remain a burden on society. That is why we continue to develop the employment of the crippled and the blind. We continue to find useful ways of using people, even handicapped people.
 
Old-age pensions, as now accepted, are contributed to throughout the working life of every individual. Care for the blind and the crippled may sound completely humanitarian, but on the contrary it is really an insurance so that society will not have an obligation to carry handicapped people as a complete burden. In the underdeveloped areas of the world the only thing open to the handicapped individual is to beg. We not only try to extend the best medical care but we try to train these individuals to earn a living, and we are constantly working with industries to open occupations to trained handicapped people, while many industries also have undertaken training programs of their own. This whole program eliminates a burden from society, just the same as pensions do which are paid for during the working life of an individual.
 
We believe in unemployment insurance. We know that it is not perfect in operation. We know that a number of things that are done for general welfare are not perfect in the way they work out, but that it would be unwise to wipe out the whole of something because there needs to be certain reforms and changes. It was felt that as we went along we would realize that unemployment insurance was not just for the benefit of the individual; it was for the benefit of our economy. It was to try to keep us from having debacles, from actually having buying power so reduced as to hurt the economy of the
 
nation as a whole. It is part of our economic insurance. There are many things that, just like freedom, we must constantly be studying and watching when we do things for the welfare of people, because we do not want to remove from people their sense of responsibility and initiative. We want them to feel that they are partners in each thing that we do, that if they function in a democracy, then what their government does comes from them. They acquiesce, they work it out, and they must not lose initiative.
 
We have not completely solved the unemployment problem because it is still open to abuse. It is safeguarded to some extent by the fact that government offices try to find jobs for people within their range of employment, which they are expected to accept. But many people have had the experience of knowing individuals who took advantage of unemployment insurance when they really could have obtained work. The law was not written to encourage such people, and so ways should be sought to eliminate existing loopholes so that it would be impossible to get unemployment insurance unless one is unable to find work in a field where one is competent.
 
All these social measures were designed to protect society from sudden fluctuations in the economy and to protect the individual from situations beyond his control which he could not completely handle by himself. They were designed as cooperative measures between the individual and his government, which, I think, is a step forward. They should not tend to remove initiative from people nor keep them from feeling a sense of individual responsibility and ambition.
 
The advantage of a democracy over the socialist state would seem to be a greater freedom, which provides for the development of the individual for free choice of a way of life and for a sense on the part of the individual of participation in the decisions made which affect his life and his future. His government tries to remove from the individual a fear of want so that he may be freer to fully develop, but it does not countenance a stepping in of government to take over the major part of the responsibility for man's existence.
 
I was struck in France by the difference between our philosophy and theirs, which are still miles apart. They do not think that it is important that a man earn a living wage. We do. I think it is the basis of the welfare of the individual.
 
Under the social-security system of France nearly every employer pays his employees less than a living wage. He pays from 35 to 50 per cent of the wage, not to the employee, but into a caisse or fund managed by the government and distributed under government auspices to families according to their size. Under this system a man with five or six children receives a considerable sum more from the government than he earns. In a democracy like ours we think it important for industry to be so organized that a man receives wages commensurate with his work and on which he can support his family. In other words, what we hope to ensure to every individual is an ability to earn a living, and the benefits of a welfare state are simply auxiliary to meet emergencies and to help a human being to meet situations that may arise in his life which he ordinarily could not meet alone.
 
There I was told very calmly, "Oh, but you do not understand our system. We know we don't insist upon a living wage, but the government gives to families, according to the number of children, an allowance. If you have five or six children you might almost as well not work because the government pays you so much more than you can possibly earn." We have to recognize that our type of capitalism in this country is different from what the same word connotes in some other countries. From the time of the last depression we have taken great strides in the recognition of the responsibility of government and industry to cooperate to prevent any disasters to the normal economy of the country. We have to be prepared to meet disasters caused by nature. We expect the government to cooperate in meetings, but we recognize the responsibility of industry today as well as of the individual. We believe that together we should strive to give every individual a chance for a decent and secure existence, and in evolving our social patterns we are trying to give both hope for better things in the future and security from want in the present.
 
Basically, all of us believe that where the people feel they have justice, opportunity, and freedom and can actually rely on the interest of their government and on the attitudes of society to help them achieve stabilization and as much security as one can ever count on in human life, there will be belief in the government and the security that no other isms will really undermine the faith in the ideas on which this country was founded.
 
We believe that together we should strive to give every individual a chance for a decent and secure existence; and in evolving our social patterns we are trying to give both hope for better things in the future and security from want as far as possible in the present.
 
These aims should not affect either the initiative of the individual or his sense of responsibility, but should give him a feeling of partnership in his government and with the economy of his country as a whole, which we hope will be a pattern that far transcends the economic pattern and the ideological promises that are made in parts of the world by Communism.
 
If we live and work for the basic ideals that our country was founded on and have justice and freedom, I think we need not have loyalty boards. We need not have inquisitions. We can trust that what we believe in and stand for will be strong enough so that we can trust each other and other people as a whole,

In the Service of Truth
 
I was talking to some young people the other night, and someone asked me if I ever found that I had to change my mind. I looked at him for a minute and said, "Yes, sometimes the very next day." It is surely a terrible thing when young people think that what you think at eighteen means that you can never think any differently, or that you are going to be held to account for what you thought at eighteen. It seems to me that means a loss of freedom.
 
It is refreshing to pay tribute to s journal that has lasted ninety years and has managed to remain free. I am quite sure that it is going to remain free. It will state the truth as the individuals who write for it see the truth. And that is something we cannot always be sure of finding today.
 
I think all writers should make up their minds that they must write as freely and as truthfully as they possibly can, because we are living in an age when people must feel sure that they are given the truth as nearly as one can find it. The atomic age is a difficult time for a democracy. If people do not understand what problems they face, it leads to apathy, to indifference, to shifting the responsibility that each individual ought to feel. That must be avoided if a democracy is really going to be a democracy.
 
We know, all of us, that if we use atomic energy for making war it is quite possible to destroy our civilization, but most of us do not know, as yet, what can happen in a world where the same energy is used for peaceful purposes. I obtained just an inkling when I was in Oak Ridge this spring. It gave me a sense of how important it was for the peoples of the world to know what good atomic energy could bring them. I hope that gradually the peoples of the world will know, but that will require patience and restraint and great confidence that the democracies will do something for them which no totalitarian
 
government can possibly accomplish. It will take The Nation and all that it can do, and many other courageous newspapers and journals and writers and speakers, to help us have faith that what we believe can win out in a world at peace. The Nation 181 (July 9, 1955): 37.
 
-------------------
 
one world that we have to deal with politically is out of reach, out of sight, out of mind. It has to be explored, reported, and imagined. Man is no Aristotelian god contemplating all existence at one glance. He is the creature of an evolution who can just about span a sufficient portion of reality to manage his survival, and snatch what on the scale of time are but a few moments of insight and happiness. Yet this same creature has invented ways of seeing what no naked eye could see, of hearing what no ear could hear, of weighing immense masses and infinitesimal ones, of counting and separating more items than he can individually remember. He is learning to see with his mind vast portions of the world that he could never see, touch, smell, hear, or remember. Gradually he makes for himself a trustworthy picture inside his head of the world beyond his reach.
 
Those features of the world outside which have to do with the behavior of other human beings, in so far as that behavior crosses ours, is dependent upon us, or is interesting to us, we call roughly public affairs. The pictures inside the heads of these human beings, the pictures of themselves, of others, of their needs, purposes, and relationship, are their public opinions. Those pictures which are acted upon by groups of people, or by individuals acting in the name of groups, are Public Opinion with capital letters. And so in the chapters which follow we shall inquire first into some of the reasons why the picture inside so often mislends men in their dealings with. the world outside. Under this heading we shall consider first the chief factors which limit their access to the facts. They are the artificial censorships, the limitations of social contact, the comparatively meager time available in each day for paying attention to public affairs, the distortion arising because events have to be compressed into very short messages, the difficulty of making a small vocabulary express a complicated world, and finally the fear of facing those facts which would seem to threaten the established routine of men's lives.
 
The analysis then turns from these more or less external limitations to the question of how this trickle of messages from the outside is affected by the stored up images, the preconceptions, and prejudices which interpret, fill them out, and in their turn powerfully direct the play of our attention, and our vision itself. From this it proceeds to examine how in the individual person the limited messages from outside, formed into a pattern of stereotypes, are identified with his own interests as he feels and conceived them. In the succeeding sections it examines how opinions are crystallized into what is called Public Opinion, how a National Will, a Group Mind, a Social Purpose, or whatever you choose to call it, is formed.
 
The first five parts constitute the descriptive section of the book. There follows an analysis of the traditional democratic theory of public opinion. The substance of the argument is that democracy in its original form never seriously faced the problem which arises because the pictures inside people's heads do not automatically correspond with the world outside. And then, because the democratic theory is under criticism by socialist thinkers, there follows an examination of the most advanced and coherent of these criticisms, as made by the English Guild Socialists. My purpose here is to find out whether these reformers take into account the main difficulties of public opinion. My conclusion is that they ignore the difficulties, as completely as did the original democrats, because they, too, assume, and in a much more complicated civilization, that somehow mysteriously there exists in the hearts of men a knowledge of the world beyond their reach.
 
I argue that representative government, either in what is ordinarily called politics, or in industry, cannot be worked successfully, no matter what the basis of election, unless there is an independent, expert organization for making the unseen facts intelligible to those who have to make the decisions. I attempt, therefore, to argue that the serious acceptance of the principle that personal representation must be supplemented by representation of the unseen facts would alone permit a satisfactory de centralization, and allow us, to escape from the intolerable and unworkable fiction that each of us must acquire a competent opinion about all public affairs. It is argued that the problem of the press is confused because the critics and the apologists expect the press to realize this fiction, expect it to make up for all that was not foreseen in the theory of democracy, and that the readers expect this miracle to be performed at no cost or trouble to themselves. The newspapers are regarded by democrats as a panacea, for their own defects, whereas analysis of the nature of news and of the economic basis of journalism seems to show that the newspapers necessarily and inevitably reflect, and therefore, in greater or lesser measure, intensify, the defective organization of public opinion. My conclusion is that public opinions must be organized for the press if they are to be sound, not by the press as is the case today. This organization conceived to be in the first instance the task of a political science that has won its proper place as formulator, in advance of real decision, instead of apologist, critic, or reporter after the decision has been made. I try to indicate that the perplexities of government and industry are conspiring to give political science this enormous opportunity to enrich itself and to serve the public. And, of course, I hope that these pages will help a few people to realize that opportunity more vividly, and therefore to pursue it more consciously.
CHAPTER XV
 
LEADERS AND THE RANK AND FILE
 
I BECAUSE of their transcendent practical import
 
ance, no successful leader has ever been too busy to cultivate the symbols which organize his following. What privileges do within the hierarchy, symbols do for the rank and file. They conserve unity. From the totem pole to the national flag, from the wooden idol to God the Invisible King, from the magic word to some diluted version of Adam Smith or Bentham, symbols have been cherished by leaders, many of whom were themselves unbelievers, because they were focal points where differences merged. The detached observer may scorn the "star spangled" ritual which hedges the symbol, perhaps as much as the king who told himself that Paris was worth a few masses. But the leader knows by experience that only when symbols have done their work is there a handle he can use to move a crowd. In the symbol emotion is discharged at a common target, and the idiosyncrasy of real idens blotted out. No wonder he hates what he calls destructive criticism, sometimes called by free spirits the elimination of buncombe. Above all things," says Bagehot, 'our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to 44 poke about it you cannot reverence it." For poking
with clear definitions and candid statements serves all high purposes known to man, except the easy conservation of a common will. Poking about, as every responsible leader suspects, tends to break the transference of emotion from the individual mind to the institutional symbol. And the first result of that is, as he rightly says, a chaos of individualism and warring sects. The disintegration of a symbol, like Holy Russia, or the Iron Diaz, is always the beginning of a long upheaval.
 
These great symbols possess by transference all the minute and detailed loyalties of an ancient and stereotyped society. They evoke the feeling that each individual has for the landscape, the furniture, the faces, the memories that are his first, and in a static society, his only reality. That core of images and devotions without which he is unthinkable to himself, is nationality. The great symbols take up these devotions, and can arouse them without calling forth the primitive images. The lesser symbols of public debate, the more casual chatter of politics, are always referred back to these proto-symbols, and if possible associated with them. The question of a proper fare on a municipal subway is symbolized as an issue between the People and the Interests, and then the People is inserted in the symbol American, so that finally in the heat of a campaign, an eight cent fare becomes unAmerican.. The Revolutionary fathers died to prevent it. Lincoln suffered that it might not come to pass, resistance to it was implied
 
in the death of those who sleep in France. Because of its power to siphon emotion out of distinct ideas, the symbol is both a mechanism of solidarity, and a mechanism of exploitation. It enables people to work for a common end, but just because the few who are strategically placed must choose the concrete objectives, the symbol is also an instrument by which a few can fatten on many, deflect criticism, and seduce men into facing agony for objects they do not understand.
 
Many aspects of our subjection to symbols are not flattering if we choose to think of ourselves as realistic, self-sufficient, and self-governing personalities. Yet it is impossible to conclude that symbols are altogether instruments of the devil. In the realm of science and contemplation they are undoubtedly the tempter himself. But in the world of action they may be beneficent, and are sometimes a necessity. The necessity is often imagined, the peril manufactured. But when quick results are imperative, the manipulation of masses through symbols may be the only quick way of having a critical thing done. It is often more important to act than to understand. It is sometimes true that the action would fail if everyone understood it. There are many affairs which cannot wait for a referendum or endure pub licity, and there are times, during war for example, when a nation, an army, and even its commanders must trust strategy to a very few minds; when two conflicting opinions, though one happens to be right, are more perilous than one opinion which is wrong. The wrong opinion may have bad results, but the two opinions may entail disaster by dissolving unity.Thus Foch and Sir Henry Wilson, who foresaw the impending disaster to Gough's army, as a consequence of the divided and scattered reserves, nevertheless kept their opinions well within a small circle, knowing that even the risk of a crushing defeat was less certainly destructive, than would have been an excited debate in the newspapers. For what matters most under the kind of tension which prevailed in March, 1918, is less the rightness of a particular move than the unbroken expectation as to the source of command. Had Foch ``gone to the people '' he might have won the debate, but long before he could have it, the armies which he was to command would have dissolved. For the spectacle of a row on Olympus is diverting and destructive.
 
But so also is a conspiracy of silence. Says Captain Wright: "It is in the High Command and not in the line, that the art of camouflage is most practiced, and reaches to highest flights. All chiefs everywhere are now kept painted, by the busy work of a number of less publicists, so as to be mistaken for Napolears at a distance... .It becomes almost impossible to displace these Napoleons, whatever their incompetence, because of the enormous public support created by hiding or glossing failure, and exaggerating or inventing success.... . But the most insidious and worst effect of this so highly organized falsity is on the generals themselves: modest and patriotic as they mostly are, and as most men must be to take up and follow the noble profession of arms, they themselves are ultimately affected by these universal illusions, and reading it every morning in the paper, they also grow persuaded they are thunderbolts of war and infallible, however much they fail, and that their maintenance in command is an end so sacred that it justifies the use of any means. . . . These various conditions, of which this great deceit is the greatest, at last emancipates all General Staffs from all control. They no longer live for the nation: the nation lives, or rather dies, for them. Victory or defeat ceases to be the prime interest. What matters to these semi-sovereign corporations is whether dear old Willie or poor old Harry is going to be at their head, or the Chantilly party will prevail over the Boulevard des Invalides party.

Yet Captain Wright who can be so eloquent and so discerning about the dangers of silence is forced nevertheless to approve the silence of Foch in not publicly destroying the illusions. There is here a complicated paradox, arising as we shall see more fully later on, because the traditional democratic view of life is conceived, not for emergencies and dangers, but for tranquility and harmony. And so where masses of people must cooperate in an uncertain and eruptive environment, it is usually necessary to secure unity and flexibility without real consent. The symbol does that. It obscures personal inten tion, neutralizes discrimination, and obfuscates in dividual purpose. It immobilizes personality, yet at the same time it enormously sharpens the intention of the group and welds that group, as nothing else in a crisis can weld it, to purposeful action. It renders the mass mobile though it immobilizes personality. The symbol is the instrument by which in the short run the mass escapes from its own inertia, the inertia of indecision, or the inertia of headlong movement, and is rendered capable of being led along the zigzag of a complex situation.

But in the longer run, the give and take increases between the leaders and the led. The word most often used to describe the state of mind in the rank and file about its leaders is morale. That is said to be good when the individuals do the part allotted to them with all their energy; when each man's whole strength is evoked by the command from above. It follows that every leader must plan his policy with this in mind. He must consider his decision not only on "the merits," but also in its effect on any part of his following whose continued support he requires. If he is a general planning an attack, he knows that his organized military units will scatter into mobs if the percentage of casualties rises too high.
 
In the Great War previous calculations were upset to an extraordinary degree, for "out of every nine men who went to France five became casualties." The limit of endurance was far greater than anyone had supposed. But there was a limit somewhere.And so, partly because of its effect on the enemy, but also in great measure because of its effect on the troops and their families, no command in this war dared to publish a candid statement of its losses. In France the casualty lists were never published. In England, America, and Germany publication of the losses of a big battle were spread out over long periods so as to destroy a unified impression of the total. Only the insiders knew until long afterwards what the Somme had cost, or the Flanders battles; ¹ and Ludendorff undoubtedly had a very much more accurate idea of these casualties than any private person in London, Paris or Chicago. All the leaders in every camp did their best to limit the amount of actual war which any one soldier or civilian could vividly conceive. But, of course, among old veterans like the French troops of 1917, a great deal more is known about war than ever reaches the public. Such an army begins to judge its commanders in terms of its own suffering. And then, when another extravagant promise of victory turns out to be the customary bloody defeat, you may find that a mutiny breaks out over some comparatively minor blunder, like Nivelle's offensive of 1917, because it is a cumulative blunder. Revolutions and mutants generally follow a small sample of a big series of evils.³The incidence of policy determines the relation between leader and following. If those whom he needs in his plan are remote from the place where the action takes place, if the results are hidden or postponed, if the individual obligations are indirect or not yet due, above all if assent is an exercise of some pleasurable emotion, the leader is likely to have a free hand. Those programs are immediately most popular, like prohibition among teetotalers, which do not at once impinge upon the private habits of the followers. That is one great reason why governments have such a free hand in foreign affairs. Most of the frictions between two states involve a series of obscure and long-winded contentions, occasionally on the frontier, but far more often in regions about which school geographies have supplied no precise ideas. In Czechoslovakia America is regarded as the Liberator; in American newspaper paragraphs and musical comedy, in American conversation by and large, it has never been finally settled whether the country we liberated is Czechoslovakia or Jugo Slovakia.
 
In foreign affairs the incidence of policy is for a very long time confined to an unseen environment. Nothing that happens out there is felt to be wholly real. And so, because in the ante-bellum period, nobody has to fight and nobody has to pay, governments go along according to their lights without much reference to their people. In local affairs the cost of a policy is more easily visible. And therefore, all but the most exceptional leaders prefer policies in which the costs are as far as possible indirect.They do not like direct taxation. They do not like to pay as they go. They like long term debts. They like to have the voters believe that the foreigner will pay. They have always been compelled to calculate prosperity in terms of the producer rather than in terms of the consumer, because the incidence on the consumer is distributed over so many trivial items. Labor leaders have always preferred an increase of money wages to a decrease in prices. There has always been more popular interest in the profits of millionaires, which are visible but comparatively unimportant, than in the wastes of the industrial system, which are huge but elusive. A legislature dealing with a shortage of houses, such as exists when this is written, illustrates this rule, first by doing nothing to increase the number of houses, second by smiting the greedy landlord on the hip, third by investigating the profiteering builders and working men. A constructive policy deals with remote and uninteresting factors, while a greedy landlord, or a profiteering plumber is visible and immediate.
 
But while people will readily believe that in an unimagined future and in unseen places a certain policy will benefit them, the actual working out of policy follows a different logic from their opinions. A nation may be induced to believe that jacking up the freight rates will make the railroads prosperous. But that belief will not make the roads prosperous, if the impact of those rates on farmers and shippers is such as to produce a commodity price beyond what the consumer can pay. Whether the consumer will pay the price depends not upon whether he nodded his head nine months previously at the proposal to raise rates and save business, but on whether he now wants a new hat or a new automobile enough to pay for them.
 
3 Leaders often pretend that they have merely uncovered a program which existed in the minds of their public. When they believe it, they are usually deceiving themselves. Programs do not invent themselves synchronously in a multitude of minds. That is not because a multitude of minds is necessarily inferior to that of the leaders, but because thought is the function of an organism, and a mass is not an organism.
 
This fact is obscured because the mass is constantly exposed to suggestion. It reads not the news, but the news with an aura of suggestion about it, indicating the line of action to be taken. It hears reports, not objective as the facts are, but already stereotyped to a certain pattern of behavior. Thus the ostensible leader often finds that the real leader is a powerful newspaper proprietor. But if, as in a laboratory, one could remove all suggestion and leading from the experience of a multitude; one would, I think, find something like this: A mass exposed to the same stimuli would develop responses that could theoretically be charted in a polygon of error. There would be a certain group that felt sufficiently alike to be classified together. There would be variants of feeling at both ends. These classifications would tend to harden as individuals in each of the classifications made their reactions vocal. That is to say, when the vague feelings of those who felt vaguely had been put into words, they would know more definitely what they felt, and would then feel it more definitely.
 
Leaders in touch with popular feelings are quickly conscious of these reactions. They know that high prices are pressing upon the masses, or that certain classes of individuals are becoming unpopular, or that feelings towards another nation are friendly or hostile. But, barring the effect of suggestion which is merely the assumption of leadership by the reporter, there would be nothing in the feeling of the mass that fatally determined the choice of any particular policy. All that the feeling of the mass demands is that policy as it is developed and exposed shall be, if not logically, then by analogy and association, connected with the original feeling.
 
So when a new policy is to be launched, there is a preliminary bid for community of feeling, as in Mark Antony's speech to the followers of Brutus.¹ In the first phase, the leader vocalizes the prevalent opinion of the mass. He identifies himself with the familiar attitudes of his audience, sometimes by telling a good story, sometimes by brandishing his patriotism, often by pinching a grievance. Finding that he is trustworthy, the multitude milling hither and thither may turn in towards him. He will then be expected to set forth a plan of campaign. But he will not find that plan in the slogans which convey the feelings of the mass. It will not even always be indicated by them. Where the incidence of policy is remote, all that is essential is that the program shall be verbally and emotionally connected at the start with what has become vocal in the multitude. Trusted men in a familiar rôle subscribing to the accepted symbols can go a very long way on their own initiative without explaining the substance of their programs.
 
But wise leaders are not content to do that. Provided they think publicity will not strengthen their position too much, and that debate will not delay action too long, they seek a certain measure of consent. They take, if not the whole mass, then the subordinates of the hierarchy sufficiently into their confidence to prepare them for what might happen, and to make them feel that they have freely willed the result. But however sincere the leader may be, there is always, when the facts are very complicated, a certain amount of illusion in these consultations. For it is impossible that all the contingencies shall be as vivid to the whole public as they are to the more experienced and the more imaginative. A fairly large percentage are bound to agree without having taken the time, or without possessing the background, for appreciating the choices which the leader presents to them. No one, however, can ask for more. And only theorists do. If we have had our day in court, if what we had to say was heard, and then if what is done comes out well, most of us do not stop to consider how much our opinion affected the business in hand.And therefore, if the established powers are sensitive and well-informed, if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling, and actually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction, no matter how slowly they proceed, provided they are seen to be proceed ing, they have little to fear. It takes stupendous and persistent blundering, plus almost infinite tactlessness, to start a revolution from below. Palace revolutions, interdepartmental revolutions, are a different matter. So, too, is demagogy. That stops at relieving the tension by expressing the feeling. But the statesman knows that such relief is temporary, and if indulged too often, unsanitary. He, therefore, sees to it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program that deals with the facts to which the feelings refer.
 
But all leaders are not statesmen, all leaders hate to resign, and most leaders find it hard to believe that bad as things are, the other fellow would not make them worse. They do not passively wait for the public to feel the incidence of policy, because the incidence of that discovery is generally upon their own heads. They are, therefore, intermittently engaged in mending their fences and consolidating their position.
 
The mending of fences consists in offering an occasional scapegoat, in redressing a minor grievance affecting a powerful individual or faction, rearranging certain jobs, placating a group of people who want an arsenal in their hometown, or a law to stop somebody's vices. Study the daily activity of any public official who depends on the election and you can enlarge this list. There are Congressmen elected year after year who never think of dissipating their energy on public affairs. They prefer to do a little service for a lot of people on a lot of little subjects, rather than to engage in trying to do a big service out there in the void. But the number of people to whom any organization can be a successful valet is limited, and shrewd politicians take care to attend either the influential, or somebody so blatantly uninfluential that to pay any attention to him is a mark of sensational magnanimity. The far greater number who cannot be held by favors, the anonymous multitude, receive propaganda.
 
The established leaders of any organization have great natural advantages. They are believed to have better sources of information. The books and papers are in their offices. They took part in the important conferences. They met important people. They have responsibility. It is, therefore, easier for them to secure attention and to speak in a convincing tone. But also they have a very great deal of control over the access to the facts. Every official is to some degree a censor. And since no one can suppress information, either by concealing it or forgetting to mention it, without some notion of what he wishes the public to know, every leader is to some degree a propagandist. Strategically placed, and compelled often to choose even at the best between the equally cogent though conflicting ideals of safety for the institution, and candor to his public, the official finds himself deciding more and more consciously what facts, in what setting, in what guise he shall permit the public to know.
 
That the manufacture of consent is capable of great refinements no one, I think, denies. The process by which public opinions arise is certainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages, and the opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the process are plain enough.
 
The creation of consent is not a new art. It is a very old one which was supposed to have died out with the appearance of democracy. But it has not died out. It has, in fact, improved enormously in technique, because it is now based on analysis rather than on rule of thumb. And so, as a result of psychological research, coupled with the modern means of communication, the practice of democracy has turned a corner. A revolution is taking place, infinitely more significant than any shifting of economic power.
 
Within the life of the generation now in control of affairs, persuasion has become a self-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government. None of us begins to understand the consequences, but it is no daring prophecy to say that the knowledge of how to create consent will alter every political calculation and modify every political premise. Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the word alone, the old constants of our thinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example, to believe in the original dogma of democracy; that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to self deception, and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.
