War and Revolution in the Middle East
How did war and revolution reshape the Middle East? The 1973 Yom Kippur War had a lasting effect across the Middle East. Egypt and Syria had again been defeated, but Israelis also felt more vulnerable after the war. The oil embargo empowered oil-exporting nations like Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Iraq. The Middle East faced deepening divisions, which added to the conflict between Israel and its neighbors. The region was reshaped by the increasing wealth of oil producers relative to other Arab states. Rising Islamic militancy led to revolution in Iran, as well as religious challenges to the rule of secular, modernizing dictatorships in countries like Egypt. The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict After the 1973 war, the United States intensified efforts to mediate a resolution to conflicts in the Middle East. Peacemaking efforts by U.S. president Jimmy Carter led to the 1978 Camp David Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors Egypt and Jordan. With the prospect of border wars between Israel and its neighbors diminished, political attention turned to the conflict between Israel and Palestinian nationalist organizations. Tensions between Syria and Israel shifted from their border into Lebanon, where Syria backed the militia Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah condemned the 1978 and 1982 Israeli invasions of Lebanon aimed at eradicating the Palestine Liberation Organization’s control of southern Lebanon, and had as one of its stated objectives the complete destruction of the state of Israel. In 1987 young Palestinians in the occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank began the intifada, a prolonged campaign of civil disobedience against Israeli soldiers. Inspired increasingly by Islamic fundamentalists, the Palestinian uprising eventually posed a serious challenge not only to Israel but also to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), long led from abroad by Yasir Arafat. The result was an unexpected and mutually beneficial agreement in 1993 between Israel and the PLO. Israel agreed to recognize Arafat’s organization and start a peace process that granted Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and called for selfrule throughout the West Bank in five years. In return, Arafat renounced violence and abandoned the demand that Israel must withdraw from all land occupied in the 1967 war. intifada Beginning in 1987, a prolonged campaign of civil disobedience by Palestinian youth against Israeli soldiers; the Arabic word intifada means “shaking off.” The peace process increasingly divided Israel. In 1995 a right-wing Jewish extremist assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In 1996 a coalition of opposition parties won a slender majority, charging the Palestinian leadership with condoning anti-Jewish violence. The new Israeli government limited Palestinian self-rule and expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank. On the Palestinian side, dissatisfaction with the peace process grew. Between 1993 and 2000 the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank doubled to two hundred thousand, and Palestinian per capita income declined by 20 to 25 percent. Failed negotiations between Arafat and Israel in 2000 unleashed an explosion of violence between Israelis and Palestinians known as the Second Intifada. In 2003 the Israeli government began to build a barrier around the West Bank, which met with opposition from Israelis and Palestinians alike. The death of Yasir Arafat, the PLO’s long-time leader, in November 2004 marked a turning point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat’s pragmatic successor, found little room for negotiation. In January 2006 Hamas, a Sunni Muslim political party, won 72 of the 136 seats in the Palestinian legislature, seizing control from Abbas and the PLO. Considered by Israel to be a terrorist organization, Hamas had gained widespread support from many Palestinians for the welfare programs it established in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Immediately after the Hamas victory, Israel, the United States, and the European Union suspended aid to the Palestinian Authority, the governing body of the West Bank and Gaza Strip established by the 1994 peace agreement. Since then, economic and humanitarian conditions for Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip have deteriorated. In 2007 Hamas, a political organization committed to building an Islamic state in the area now composed of Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank, assumed control of the Gaza Strip, deepening political divisions in Palestinian territory. In 2010, 63 percent of the 1.5 million citizens of Gaza lived below the United Nations–defined poverty line.

(AWAD/Getty Images) Egypt: Arab World Leader From the time of Gamal Nasser’s seizure of power in 1956 to the mid1970s, Egypt, due to its large military, its anti-imperialist rhetoric, and its support for Arab unity, was recognized as the leader of the Arab world. In 1978 Egypt’s president, Anwar Sadat (1918–1981), negotiated a peace settlement with Israel known as the Camp David Accords. Though Egypt gained the return of the Sinai Peninsula from Israel, some Arab leaders denounced Sadat’s initiative as treason. After Sadat was assassinated by religious radicals in 1981, Egyptian relations with Israel deteriorated, but Egypt and Israel maintained their fragile peace as Sadat’s successor, Hosni Mubarak, took office. Mubarak remained a consistent supporter of Israel and a mediator between Israel and the Arab world. In return for helping to stabilize the region, the United States gave Egypt billions of dollars in development, humanitarian, and military aid. Domestically, this aid failed to yield economic development, and Mubarak ruled with an increasingly dictatorial hand. Many of the government’s critics charged that massive fraud and corruption funneled

Egypt’s wealth to a privileged few. Over 40 percent of Egyptians lived in poverty. Under Mubarak’s thirty-year regime, an emergency law that had been in place since 1967 legalized censorship, suspended limited freedom of expression and assembly, allowed for the establishment of a special security court, and gave the government the right to arrest people without charge and detain prisoners indefinitely. Mubarak used the emergency law to create a wholly separate justice system in order to silence opposition and repress anyone perceived as a threat to his rule. Demonstrations, political organizations, and even financial donations that were not approved by the government were banned under the law. Thousands of people were arrested. In December 2010 demonstrations broke out in Tunisia against the twenty-three-year authoritarian rule of President Zine Ben Ali, leading to his downfall in January 2011. This populist revolt soon spread across North Africa and the Middle East, including to the streets of Cairo and other cities in Egypt as Egyptians of all ages united in revolt against Mubarak’s dictatorial rule. After three weeks of growing demonstrations, coordinated through Facebook, Twitter, and other communications networks, Mubarak stepped down as president in 2011 and was arrested soon after. Libya, located between Tunisia and Egypt, also witnessed an uprising against its dictatorial leader of forty-two years, Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi struggled violently to remain in power, but was deposed and killed amid European and U.S. air strikes. That same year, a lengthy and intense civil war erupted in Syria, pitting opponents of ruler Bashar alAssad against an army equipped and trained to oppose Israel. The “Arab Spring” uprisings that swept the Middle East shook a political order that had rested in the hands of the armed forces and pursued secular, nationalist objectives. The deposed leaders were the ideological descendants of Nasser, though their regimes had come to rely more on force than on modernizing social reform. The reaction against these regimes was often religious and culturally conservative. The political transitions resulting from this upheaval tended to pit secular and religious factions against each other amid debates over the nature of government and social change. Among the countries where regimes were brought down by Arab Spring protesters, Egypt alone reversed course, returning to rule by the secular armed forces under the leadership of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Revolution and War in Iran and Iraq In oil-rich Iran foreign powers competed for political influence in the

decades after the Second World War, and the influence of the United States in particular helped trigger a revolutionary backlash. In 1953 Iran’s prime minister, Muhammad Mossadegh (MOH-sah-dehk) (1882–1967), tried to nationalize the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, forcing the pro-Western shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi (r. 1941–1979) to flee to Europe. Mossadegh’s victory was short-lived. Loyal army officers, with the help of the American CIA, quickly restored the shah to his throne. Pahlavi set out to build a powerful modern nation to ensure his rule, and Iran’s gigantic oil revenues provided the necessary cash. The shah pursued land reform, secular education, and increased power for the central government. Modernization was accompanied by corruption and dictatorship. The result was a violent reaction against secular values: an Islamic revolution in 1979 aimed at infusing Islamic principles into all aspects of personal and public life. Led by the cleric Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini, the fundamentalists deposed the shah and tried to build their vision of a true Islamic state. Iran’s revolution frightened its neighbors. Iraq, especially, feared that Iran — a nation of Shi’ite (SHEE-ight) Muslims — would succeed in getting Iraq’s Shi’ite majority to revolt against its Sunni leaders (Map 32.1). In September 1980 Iraq’s ruler, Ba’ath Party leader Saddam Hussein (1937–2006), launched a surprise attack against Iran. With their enormous oil revenues and powerful armed forces, Iran and Iraq — Persians and Arabs, Islamists and nationalists — clashed in an eight-year conflict that killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides before ending in a modest victory for Iran in 1988.

Mapping the Past
MAP 32.1 Abrahamic Religions in the Middle East and Surrounding Regions Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, which all trace their origins back to the patriarch Abraham, have significant populations in the Middle East. Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, Shi’ites throughout the region have become more vocal in their demands for equality and power. One of the largest stateless ethnic groups, the Kurds, who follow various religions, has become a major player in the politics of the region, especially in Iraq and Turkey, where the group seeks Kurdish independence. ANALYZING THE MAP Which religion dominates? Where are the largest concentrations of Jews and Christians in the Middle East located? CONNECTIONS How have divisions between Shi’ite and Sunni Muslims contributed to war in the region? In 1990, saddled with the costs of war, Hussein commanded an invasion of oil-rich Kuwait and proclaimed its annexation to Iraq. To Hussein’s surprise, his troops were driven out of Kuwait by an Americanled, United Nations–sanctioned military coalition, which included Arab forces from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. The United Nations Security Council imposed economic sanctions on Iraq as soon as it invaded Kuwait, and these sanctions continued after the 1990–1991 Persian Gulf War, to force Iraq to destroy its stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons

under United Nations supervision. Alleging that Iraq still had such weapons, the United States led an invasion of Iraq in 2003 that overthrew Saddam Hussein’s regime. The invasion led to the Second Persian Gulf War, which involved a lengthy U.S. occupation and a violent insurgency against U.S. military forces, which remained in Iraq until 2011. As secular Iraq staggered, Iran’s revolutionary regime seemed to moderate. Executive power in Iran was divided between a Supreme Leader and twelve-member Guardian Council selected by high Islamic clerics, and a popularly elected president and parliament. After reformist leaders pressed for relaxation of strict Islamic decrees, the Supreme Leader, controlling the army and the courts, vetoed the reforms and jailed some of the religious leadership’s most vocal opponents, creating a context for the election of conservative populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (ahh-MAHdeen-eh-jahd) (b. 1956). Ahmadinejad engaged in brinksmanship over the development of a nuclear weapons program, called for Israel’s destruction, and backed the Hamas Party in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. He won reelection in 2009 after a bitterly contested challenge from moderates. The government suppressed a “green revolution” of protests that echoed the Arab Spring. In 2013 opposition groups came together to support the election of Hassan Rouhani, a centrist cleric who promised civil rights reforms. In 2015 Rouhani reached an agreement with a group of world powers led by the United States to freeze the country’s nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions that had sapped Iran’s economy.
