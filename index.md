Vaclav Havel "The Power of the Powerless" (1978)
 
HA SPECTER is haunting Eastern Europe: the specter of what in the West is called "dissent" This specter has not appeared out of thin air. It is a natural and inevitable consequence of the present historical phase of the system it is haunting. It was born at a time when this system, for a thousand reasons, can no longer base itself on the unadulterated, brutal, and arbitrary application of power, eliminating all expressions of nonconformity. What is more, the system has become so ossified politically that there is practically no way for such nonconformity to be implemented within its official structures....
 
Our system is most frequently characterized as a dictatorship or, more precisely, as the dictatorship of a political bureaucracy over a society which has undergone economic and social leveling. I am afraid that the term "dictatorship," regardless of how intelligible it may otherwise be, tends to obscure rather than clarify the real nature of power in this system... Even though our dictatorship has long since alienated itself completely from the social movements that give birth to it, the authenticity of these movements (and I am thinking of the proletarian and socialist movements of the nineteenth century) gives it undeniable historicity. These origins provided a solid foundation of sorts on which it could build until it became the utterly new social and political reality it is today, which has become so inextricably a part of the structure of the modern world. It commands an incomparably more precise, logically structured, generally comprehensible and, in essence, extremely flexible ideology that, in its elaborateness and completeness, is almost a secularized religion. It offers a ready answer to any question whatsoever, it can scarcely be accepted only in part, and accepting it has profound implications for human life. In an era when metaphysical and existential certainties are in a state of crisis, when people are being uprooted and alienated and are losing their sense of what this world means, this ideology inevitably has a certain hypnotic charm....
 
The profound difference between our system-in terms of the nature of power-and what we traditionally understand by dictatorship, a difference I hope is clear even from this quite superficial comparison, has caused me to search for some term appropriate for our system, purely for the purposes of this essay. If I refer to it henceforth as a "post-totalitarian" system, I am fully aware that this is perhaps not the most precise term, but I am unable to think of a better one. I do not wish to imply by the prefix "post" that the system is no longer totalitarian; on the contrary, I mean that it is totalitarian in a way fundamentally different from classical dictatorships, different from totalitarianism as we usually understand it.
 
The manager of a fruit-and-vegetable shop places in his window, among the onions and carrots, the slogan: "Workers of the world, unite!" Why does he do it? What is he trying to communicate to the world? Is he genuinely enthusiastic about the idea of unity among the work of the world? Is his enthusiasm so great that he feels an irrepressible impulso to acquaint the public with his ideals? Has he really given more than a moment's thought to how such a unification might occur and what it would mean?
 
I think it can safely be assumed that the overwhelming majority of shopkeepers never think about the slogans they put in their windows, nor do they use them to express their real opinions. That poster was delivered to our greengrocer from the enterprise headquarters along with the onions and carrots. He put them all into the window simply because it has been done that way for years, because everyone does it, and because that is the way it has to be. If he were to refuse, there could be trouble. He could be reproached for not having the proper decoration in his window; someone might even accuse him of disloyalty. He does it because these things must be done if one is to get along in life. It is one of the thousands of details that guarantee him a relatively tranquil life "in harmony with society," as they say.
 
Obviously the greengrocer does not put the slogan in his window from any personal desire to acquaint the public with the ideal it expresses. This, of course, does not mean that his action has no motive or significance at all, or that the slogan communicates nothing to anyone. The slogan is really a sign, and as such it contains a subliminal but very definite message. Verbally, it might be expressed this way: "I, the greengrocer XY, live here and I know what I must do. behave in the manner expected of me. I can be depended upon and am beyond reproach. I am obedient and therefore I have the right to be left in peace." This message, of course, has an addressee: it is directed above, to the greengrocer's superior, and at the same time it is a shield that protects the greengrocer from potential informers. The slogan's real meaning, therefore, is rooted firmly in the greengrocer's existence. It reflects his vital interests. But what are those vital interests?
 
Let us take note: if the greengrocer had been instructed to display the slogan "I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient;' he would not be nearly as indifferent to its semantics, even though the statement would reflect the truth. The greengrocer would be embarrassed and ashamed to put such an unequivocal statement of his own degradation in the shop window, and quite naturally so, for he is a human being and thus has a sense of his own dignity. To overcome this complication, his expression of loyalty must take the form of a sign which, at least on its textual surface, indicates a level of disinterested conviction. It must allow the greengrocer to say, "What's wrong with the workers of the world uniting?" Thus the sign helps the greengrocer to conceal from himself the low foundations of his obedience, at the same time concealing the low foundations of power. It hides them behind the facade of something high. And that something is ideology.
 
Ideology is a specious way of relating to the world. It offers human beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them. As the repository of something suprapersonal and objective, it enables people to deceive their conscience and conceal their true position and their inglorious modus vivendi, both from the world and from themselves. It is a very pragmatic but, at the same time, an apparently dignified way of legitimizing what is above, below, and on either side. It is directed toward people and toward God. It is a veil behind which human beings can hide their own fallen existence, their trivialization, and their adaptation to the status quo. It is an excuse that everyone can use, from the greengrocer, who conceals his fear of losing his job behind an alleged interest in the unification of the workers of the world, to the highest functionary, whose interest in staying in power can be cloaked in phrases about service to the working class. The primary excusatory fiction of ideology, therefore, is to provide people, both as victims and pillars of the post totalitarian system, with the illusion that the system is in harmony with the human order and the order of the universe.
 
The post-totalitarian system touches people at every step, but it does so with its ideological gloves on. This is why life in the system is so thoroughly permeated with hypocrisy and lies government by bureaucracy is called popular government, the working class is enslaved in the name of the working class; the complete degradation of the individual is presented as his ultimate liberation; depriving people of information is called making it available; the use of power to manipulate is called the public control of power, and the arbitrary abuse of power is called observing the legal code; the repression of culture is called its development; the expansion of imperial influence is presented as support for the oppressed: the lack of free expression becomes the highest form of freedom; farcical elections become the highest form of democracy banning independent thought becomes the most scientific of world views; military occupation becomes fraternal assistance. Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must falsify everything. It falsifies the past. It falsifies the present, and it falsifies the future. It falsifies statistics. It pretends not to possess an omnipotent and unprincipled police apparatus. It pretends to respect human rights. It pretends to persecute no one. It pretends to fear nothing. It pretends to pretend nothing.
 
[10) Individuals need not believe all these mystifications, but they must behave as though they did, or they must at least tolerate them in silence, or get along well with those who work with them. For this reason, however, they must live within a lie. They need not accept the lie. It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it. For by this very fact, individuals confirm the system, fulfill the system, make the system, are the system.
 
on Why in fact did our greengrocer have to put his loyalty on display in the shop window? Had he not already displayed it sufficiently in various internal or semi public ways? At trade union meetings, after all, he had always voted as he should. He had always taken part in various competitions. He voted in elections like a good citizen. He had even signed the "antiCharter." Why, on top of all that, should he have to declare his loyalty publicly? After all, the people who walk past his window will certainly not stop to read that, in the greengrocer's opinion, the workers of the world ought to unite. The fact of the matter is, they don't read the slogan at all, and it can be fairly assumed they don't even see it. If you were to ask a woman who had stopped in front of his shop what she saw in the window, she could certainly tell whether or not they had tomatoes today, but it is highly unlikely that she noticed the slogan at all, let alone what it said.
 
alt seems senseless to require the greengrocer to declare his loyalty publicly. But it makes sense nevertheless. People ignore his slogan, but they do so because such slogans are also found in other shop windows, on lampposts, bulletin boards, in apartment windows, and on buildings; they are everywhere, in fact. They form part of the panorama of everyday life. Of course, while they ignore the details, people are very aware of that panorama as a whole. And what else is the greengrocer's slogan but a small component in that huge backdrop to daily life?
 
The greengrocer had to put the slogan in his window, therefore, not in the hope that someone might read it or be persuaded by it, but to contribute, along with thousands of other slogans, to the panorama that everyone is very much aware of. This panorama, of course, has a subliminal meaning as well, it reminds people where they are living and what is expected of them. It tells them what everyone else is doing, and indicates to them what they must do as well, if they don't want to be excluded, to fall into isolation, alienate themselves from society, break the rules of the game, and risk the loss of their peace and tranquility and security...
 
Let us now imagine that one day something in our greengrocer snaps and he stops putting up the slogans murley to ingratiate himself. He stops voting in elections he knows are a farce. Ho begins to say what he really thinks at political meetings. And he even finds the strength in himself to express solidarity with those whom his conscience commands him to support. In this revolt the greengrocer steps out of living within the lie. He rejects the ritual and breaks the rules of the game. He discovers once more his suppressed identity and dignity. He gives his freedom a concrete significance. His revolt is an attempt to live within the truth..
 
The bill is not long in coming. He will be relieved of his post as manager of the shop and transferred to the warehouse. His pay will be reduced. His hopes for a holiday in Bulgaria will evaporate. His children's access to higher education will be threatened. His superiors will harass him and his fellow workers will wonder about him. Most of those who apply these sanctions, however, will not do so from any authentic inner conviction but simply under pressure from conditions, the same conditions that once pressured the greengrocer to display the official slogans. They will persecute the greengrocer either because it is expected of them, or to demonstrate their loyalty, or simply as part of the general panorama, to which belongs an awareness that this is how situations of this sort are dealt with, that this, in fact, is how things are always done, particularly if one is not to become suspect oneself. The executors, therefore, behave essentially like everyone else, to a greater or lesser degree: as components of the post totalitarian system, as agents of its automatism, as petty instruments of the social auto-totality.
 
(16)Thus the power structure, through the agency of those who carry out the sanctions, those anonymous components of the system, will spew the greengrocer from its mouth. The system, through its alienating presence in people, will punish him for his rebellion. It must do so because the logic of its automatism and self-defense dictate it. The greengrocer has not committed a simple, individual offense, isolated in its own uniqueness, but something incomparably more serious. By breaking the rules of the game, he has disrupted the game as such. He has exposed it as a mere game. He has shattered the world of appearances, the fundamental pillar of the system. He has upset the power structure by tearing apart what holds it together. He has demonstrated that living a lie is living a lie. He has broken through the exalted facade of the system and exposed the real, base foundations of power. He has said that the emperor is naked. And because the emperor is in fact naked, something extremely dangerous has happened: by his action, the greengrocer has addressed the world. He has enabled everyone to peer behind the curtain. He has shown everyone that it is possible to live within the truth. Living within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal. The principle must embrace and permeate everything. There are no terms whatsoever on which it can co-exist with living within the truth, and therefore everyone who steps out of line denies it in principle and threatens it in its entirety....
 
The original and most important sphere of activity, one that predetermines all the others, is simply an attempt to create and support the independent life of society as an articulated expression of living within the truth. In other words, serving truth consistently, purposefully, and articulately, and organizing this service. This is only natural, after all: if living within the truth is an elementary starting point for every attempt made by people to oppose the alienating pressure of the system, if it is the only meaningful basis of any independent act of political import, and if ultimately, it is also the most intrinsic existential source of the "dissident" attitude, then it is difficult to imagine that even manifest "dissent" could have any other basis than the service of truth, the truthful life, and the attempt to make room for the genuine aims of life.

NEW MAY FOURTH MANIFESTO
 
Fellow students, fellow countrymen:
 
Seventy years ago today, a large group of illustrious students assembled in front of Tiananmen, and a new chapter in the history of China was opened. Today, we are once again assembled here, not only to commemorate that monumental day but more importantly, to carry forward the May Fourth spirit of science and democracy. Today, in front of the symbol of the Chinese nation, Tiananmen, we can proudly proclaim to all the people in our nation that we are worthy of the pioneers of seventy years
 
For over one hundred years, the pioneers of the Chinese people have been searching for a path to modernize an ancient and beleaguered China. Following the Paris Peace Conference, they did not collapse in the face of imperialist oppression, but marched boldly forward. Waving the banners of science and democracy, they launched the mighty May Fourth Movement. May Fourth and the subsequent New Democratic Revolution were the first steps in the patriotic democracy movement of Chinese students. From this point on, Chinese history entered a completely new phase. Due to the socioeconomic conditions in China and the shortcomings of intellectuals, the May Fourth ideals of science and democracy have not been realized. Seventy years of history have taught us that democracy and sci
 
1. The "Paris Peace Conference" was the Versailles Peace Conference held in 1919 by the five allies (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan) a the defeat of Germany World World L. As the conference began, many Chinese people, including intellectuals and students, expected that Germany's colonial claims in China, and particularly its claim to a large portion of Shandong Province under a ninety-nine-year lease forced on the Chinese government in 1898, would be annulled. The Chinese delegation's acceptance of an agreement between the Five Powers under which Japan took over Germany's colonial rights set off a bitter storm of protest in China, and was the immediate cause of the May Fourth Incident in which students protested in Tiananmen. con de conscu in one fell swoop and that impatience and despair are of no avail. In the context of China's economy and culture. the Marxism espoused by the Chinese Communist Party cannot avoid being influenced by remnants of feudal ideology. Thus, while New China has steadily advanced toward modernization, it has greatly neglected building a democracy. Although it has emphasized the role of science, n has not valued the spirit of science democracy. At present, our country is plagued with problems such as a bloated government bureaucracy, serious corruption, the devaluation of intellectual work, and inflation, all of which severely impede us from intensifying the reforms and carrying out modernization. This illustrates that if the spirit of science and democracy, and their actual processes, do not exist, numerous and varied feudal elements and remnants of the old system, which are fundamentally antagonistic to large-scale socialist production, will re-emerge in society, and modernization will be impossible. For this reason, carrying on the May Fourth spirit, hastening the reform of the political system, protecting human rights, and strengthening rule by law have become urgent tasks of modernization that we must undertake.
 
Fellow students, fellow countrymen, a democratic spirit is precisely the absorption of the collective wisdom of the people, the true development of each individual's ability, and the protection of each individual's interests; a scientific spirit is precisely respect for individual nature, and the building of the country on the basis of science. Now more than ever, we need to review the experiences and lessons of all student movements since May Fourth, to make science and rationalism a system, a process. Only then can the tasks the May Fourth Movement set before us be accomplished, only then can the spirit of May Fourth be carried forward, and only then can our wish for a strong China be realized.
 
Fellow students, fellow countrymen, the future and fate of the Chinese nation are intimately linked to each of our hearts. This student movement has but one goal, that is, to facilitate the process of modernization by raising high the banners of democracy and science, by liberating people from the constraints of feudal ideology, and by promoting freedom, human rights, and rule by law. To this end, we urge the government to accelerate the pace of political reform, to guarantee the rights of the people vested in the law, to implement a press law, to permit privately run news pers, to eradicate corruption, and democratic government, to value education, to respect intellectual work, and to save the nation through science. Our views are not in harmony with those of the government. We only have one goal: the modern Eation of China.
 
Our present tasks are: first, to take the lead in carrying out experiments in democratic reform at the birthplace of the student movement the university campus, democratizing and systematizing campus life; sec end, to participate actively in politics, to persist in our request for a dialogue with the government, to push democratic reforms of our political system, to oppose graft and corruption, and to work for a press law. We recognize that these short-term objectives are only the first steps in democratic reform; they are tiny, unsteady steps. But we must struggle for these first steps, we must cheer for these first steps.
 
Fellow students, fellow countrymen, prosperity for our nation is the ultimate objective of our patriotic student movement. Democracy, science, freedom, human rights, and rule by law are the ideals that hundreds of thousands of university students share in this struggle. Our ancient, thousand-year civilization is waiting, our great people, one billion strong, are watching. What qualms can we possibly have? What is there to fear? Fellow students, fellow countrymen, here at richly symbolic Tian anmen, let us once again search together and struggle together for democracy, for science, for freedom, for human rights, and for rule by law. Let our cries awaken our young Republic!
 
(read by Wuer Kaixi at Tiananmen Square May 4, 1989)
 
"The source of China's illness is 'centralized leadership' [under the Party]; the solution is democracy."
 
For some observers of the student movement, the New May Fourth Manifesto encapsulated the nature of the students' protests: passionate, but vague and weak in ideas. Indeed, from the first week of the protests, otherwise approving sympathizers had expressed the opinion that the youth in Tiananmen lacked a clear concept of democracy and of the specific reforms China needed. Student leaders defended the generality of their slogans and public statements by explaining that broader, more abstract themes had greater mass appeal than narrower ones; the "With Blood Write the Preface to China's Future"
 
The government's efforts to clear Tiananmen had been stymied once again by the defiant people of Beijing. But this time the government would not hold back the army: the Democracy Movement was to be suppressed at all costs. By evening troops from various Chinese army commands were moving into Beijing from all directions under orders to reach Tiananmen, with force if necessary. As they ac vanced, they met with stiff opposition: barricades of all sorts lay across street intersections and in some sites, crowds of young men, sometimes assisted by women and older people, hurled bricks and Molotov cocktails at troops and their vehicles Beginning at around 10 P.M., troops moving east on Chang'an Avenue toward Tian. Anmen unleashed a savage and often random barrage of firepower as they slowly progressed against fierce resistance, mowing down not only workers and students defending barricades, but also any persons moving within their range. Bloody battles also occurred to the south of Tiananmen before troops pushed their way through to the Square.
 
By approximately 1:30 A.M., Tiananmen was surrounded by troops. The full story of the next hours may never be known. It is generally agreed that between 1:30 and 6:00 A.M., the army proceeded to clear the Square, first sealing it off and then forcing thousands of students and their supporters to withdraw through its south east corner. But details of the operation are not clear; many outside of China question the Chinese government's official account, which states that no persons were killed in the Square. According to that account, troops permitted students and citizens to leave the Square peacefully before tanks knocked down the Goddess of Democracy and the demonstrators' tents; a few "obstinate '' persons who refused to leave were forcibly removed. However, eyewitness accounts of firing in the Square, the sound of heavy gunfire from in the Square between 5:00 and 6:00, and self-contradictory government accounts, have all cast serious doubts over the veracity of the government's version.
 
If soldiers did fire on and kill people in the Square, as appears likely from independent eyewitness accounts, the number of casualties probably was small in comparison to the many deaths on western Chang'an Avenue. For many Chinese, however, the question of whether people died in Tiananmen has assumed a special importance, becoming the issue in which they seek the ultimate proof of their government's moral bankruptcy and of the democracy protests' sacrifice. This may explain why the taped account of Chai Ling, the head of the Tiananmen Command Center, and other eyewitness accounts of what happened in the Square have been published over and over again in Hong Kong and in Chinese-language books on the Democracy Movement. Excerpts of Chai Ling's taped account, which was made by her on June 8 and smuggled out of China to Hong Kong, where it was broadcast by
 
the Hong Kong Television Corporation, are presented below. As of winter 1989, Chai Ling was rumored still to be hiding somewhere in China.
 
"I AM CHAI LING... I AM STILL ALIVE"
 
(excerpts)
 
It is 4:00 in the afternoon on June 8, 1989. I am Chai Ling. I am the General Commander of the Tiananmen Command Center. I am still alive. I think I am the most authoritative commentator to speak on the overall situation in the Square during the period from June 2 to June 4. I also have an obligation to tell the true story to each of you, each and every citizen, each and every compatriot.
 
After around 10:00 P.M. On June 2, the first signal [of the impending repression] was that [we heard that] a police car had hit four innocent people, and three of them had already died. Then immediately following this, the second signal came: [we learned that] entire truckloads of soldiers had abandoned their guns, uniforms, and other weapons, letting them fall into the hands of the citizens and my classmates who were blocking the trucks. The students, very vigilant about this sort of behavior, immediately collected these objects and turned them into the Public Security Bureau, as our receipt proves. The third signal came at 2:10 in the afternoon on June 3, when a large force of soldiers and People's Armed Police beat students and local residents at Xinhuamen and Liu bukou [the street corner just west of Xinhuanet]. At the time our classmates were standing on top of a bus yelling through megaphones, "the people's police love the people," "the people's police don't beat people." Just as one of our classmates was yelling out the first sentence, a soldier charged forward, kicked him in the stomach, and swore at him, "who in the hell loves you!" This was promptly followed by a truncheon, and the boy fell over immediately.
 
Let me explain a bit about our positions. I am the General Commander [of the Protect Tiananmen Headquarters]. We had set up a broadcast station in the Square. It was [originally] the hunger strikers' broadcast station. I always stayed there, directing the activities of all the students in the Square through broadcasts. Of course there were other students in the Headquarters, such as Li Lu, Feng Congde, and others. We frequently received emergency reports about various developments. There were continued reports of students and residents being beaten, of being cruelly injured.... At precisely 9:00, all the students at Tiananmen Square rose, and rais ing their right hands, took an oath: "I swear that for the sake of advanc ing the democratization of our motherland, for the true prosperity of our nation, for our great motherland, I pledge to use my own youthful life to protect Tiananmen and defend the Republic, not to overthrow a small clique of conspirators but in order that 1.1 billion people do not lose their lives amid a white terror. Heads may be cut off and blood may flow, but the people's Square cannot be lost. We are willing to use our youthful lives to fight down to the last person."
 
At precisely 10:00, the Square's Democracy University officially opened for classes. The Vice General Commander [of the Headquarters], Zhang Boli, was appointed its president. People from all quarters expressed warm congratulations on the establishment of Democracy University. At the Headquarters, where emergency reports were being received continuously, the situation was extremely tense, while at another section of the Square, in the north, applause thundered for the founding of Democracy University. The university was located near the Goddess of Liberty (in the northern part of the square], and to its east and west on Chang'an Avenue, blood flowed like a river.
 
The slaughterers, the soldiers of the 27th Army, used tanks, assault weapons, and bayonets (the time for tear gas had passed) on people who had yelled only a lone slogan or only had thrown a single brick. They used automatic guns to mow them down so that the chests of all of the dead were soaked in blood. Our classmates ran to the Headquarters. Their hands, chests, and legs were covered with blood, their compatriots' last drops of blood; they had held their [dying] classmates in their own arms.
 
Since April, when the movement was a student-led patriotic democratic movement, all the way to the present, when the movement has grown into a nationwide movement, our guiding principle has been [to engage in] peaceful protest; our principle for struggle has been peaceful protest. Many students, workers, and citizens came to our headquarters to tell us that since the situation had reached this state, we should take up arms. Male students were also extremely agitated... [but] we at the Headquarters said to everyone: "our struggle is one of peaceful protest, and the highest principle of peace is sacrifice."
 
In this spirit, we all emerged from our tents slowly, one by one, hand in hand, shoulder by shoulder, to the sound of the "Internationale," and walked over to the northern, western, and southern sides of the Monument to the People's Heroes. Everybody sat there quietly, awaiting with

calm expressions the butcher knives of the slaughterers. We were carrying out a war of love and hate, and not a battle of military force....
 
The students just sat there quietly, lying down to await the [moment of sacrifice. At this time, megaphones inside the headquarters tent and loudspeakers outside played the song, "The Descendants of the Dragon" [a popular song about the Chinese race by Hou Dejian]. Our classmates sang along with the music, their eyes welling up with tears. Everybody hugged each other and held hands, for each person knew the last moment of his or her life had arrived, the moment had come to sacrifice our lives for the Chinese people....
 
At around two or three in the morning [as troops in the Square began moving in toward us], we had no choice but to abandon the Headquarters and retreat to the broadcast station at the foot of the Heroes' Monument. As General Commander, I mobilized the students for one last time, directing them to encircle the Heroes' Monument. The students [in the first row] sat there calmly. They said to me, "We'll just sit here quietly. We in the first row are the most determined." [Behind them), other students said. "We in the back will also sit here quietly. Even if the classmates in the first row are beaten and killed, we will just sit here calmly. We will. not move and we absolutely will not kill."
 
I said a few words to everyone. I told them, "There is an ancient legend. According to this legend, there was once a colony of about 1.1. billion ants. One day the mountain the ants lived on caught on fire, and the ants had to escape down to the foot of the mountain if they were to live. At that point, the ants formed a ball and rolled down the mountain. The ants on the outside burned to death, but even more ants survived....
 
"My fellow students, we in the Square, we already stand at the outermost layer of the Chinese people, for each of us in our hearts is clear: only the sacrifice of our lives will suffice for the life of the republic."
 
The students began singing the "Internationale," over and over again they sang it, hands clasped tightly together. Finally, our four compatriots who were hunger striking, Hou Dejian, Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Duo, [and Gao Xin] could no longer restrain themselves. They said, "Children, do not make any more sacrifices."
 
Each and every one of us was utterly exhausted. The hunger strikers went to negotiate with the military and found a military representative who claimed to be responsible for the Martial Law Command Headquarters. They said, "We will withdraw from the Square, but we hope you will guarantee the safety of the students. We will withdraw peacefully." At the same time, our Headquarters was soliciting the opinions of the students, asking them whether they wanted to stay or to withdraw. We decided that all the students would withdraw. But at that moment, that bunch of slaughterers violated their promise: as the students were leaving, soldiers wearing combat helmets and armed with machine guns charged to the third tier of steps at the platform of the Monument. Before the Headquarters had a chance to announce the decision to withdraw, our loud speakers had been strafed into shreds. This was the People's Monument! It was the Monument to the People's Heroes! They were actually shooting at the Monument. Most of the rest of the students retreated, crying as they retreated....
 
Some say more than 200 students died; there are also others who say 4,000 have already died in the Square. Up to now, I still don't know the exact number. But every one of the people at the Workers' Autonomous Union near the [northern] edge of the Square perished. There were at least 20 or 30 of them....
 
As we went around Mao's mausoleum [immediately south of the Peo ple's Monument] hand in hand, heading west from the south end of the Square, we saw a dark mass of some 10,000 helmeted soldiers seated at the southern side of the Monument. The students screamed at them "Dogs!" "Fascists!"...
 
We wanted to stick out our chests and march back to the Square. All the residents stopped us. They said, "Children, do you know, they' set up machine guns, don't make any more sacrifices." So we could only continue heading [west] toward the Xicheng District from Xidan. On the road we saw four corpses of residents. The farther north we went. tu closer we got to our schools, the more citizens' eyes were filled with tears
 
When the last ranks of students who had withdrawn from Tiananmen Square arrived at Beijing University, this marked the forced end of the Car Movement, which had started on May 13 with a hunger strike and then had become a peaceful sit-in protest. Later we obtained informa which said that at 10:00 on the night of June 3, Li Peng had given the orders: first, army troops were permitted to open fire; second, militam vehicles were to enter the city at full speed and recover the Square becer dawn on June 4; and third, the organizers and leaders of the movement were to be killed, without exception.
 
Compatriots, this is the ruthless, crazed, bogus government that com ues to deploy troops [around Beijing] and to rule China. The Beijing Massacre is happening at this very moment; massacres all over China will slowly commence if they are not already occurring. But my dear compatriots, as the night darkens, dawn approaches. As this regime becomes increasingly fascist, crazed, and oppressive, [the Chinese people will awaken,] and a true people's democratic republic will be born. This is the final juncture for the survival of the Chinese people. Compatriots, all on izens with a conscience, all Chinese, awaken! The final victory will be yours! The day is fast approaching when the Central Committee that per tends to speak for the Party-Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wang Zhen. and Bo Yibo-will be annihilated!
 
Down with fascism!
 
Down with military rule!
 
The people will be victorious! Long live the republic!
 
(based on the Hong Kong Television Corporate broadcast on June ro of Chai Ling's tape of June 8, 1989)
 
Chinese across the country reacted to the June 3 massacre with rage and anguish. On streets and campuses, paper mourning wreaths hung in somber contrast to militant posters demanding "blood for blood." Yet even those who advocated violent resistance to the army's occupation in Beijing recognized the futility of an armed citizenry challenging tanks and machine guns. Student leaders refused to abandon the principle of nonviolence. They placed their last hope for bringing down e government on general strikes that would paralyze China's cities. The first selection below, a broadcast from the student broadcast station at People's University. s an example of the emotional appeal for unity that went out to citizens in the first dars after the massacre. The second selection, a student poster from Nanjing, recalls the kind of rage felt by many students after the killings.
 
THE VOICE OF BEIJING WILL BE ONE WITH THE PEOPLE"
 
Dear listeners and friends, the entire staff of the Voice of Beijing has al
 
I have already spent twenty nights together with all of you. Last night we could
 
not help wiping the tears from our faces as we cried out: farewell! Fare well, our dear people! Although we have met with a slaughter, the voice of truth will be eternal among the people! But today, our classmates, our elder brothers, our teachers, our respected and dear people of Beijing, as you innocently fell under the butcher's knife, you became the cannon fodder for the power struggle among the Central Committee's top leaders. Your blood will absolutely not be shed in vain! We must respond with 4 citywide strikes: workers must strike, students must boycott classes, and there must be a general strike; we must stop the entire country from func noning.... We must clear-headedly see just how base the vicious inten pons of the authorities have become. In the several days before the depression, the authorities maliciously tried to provoke clashes between soldiers and the people. In the course of one night, they provoked [the soldiers] into becoming beasts. But let us think calmly for a moment. The true beasts are those who encourage conflict from behind the scenes! The soldiers also have their loved ones; they too are people. We thus should unite all the patriotic soldiers whom we can unite, and isolate the beasts lurking behind the scenes-they are the true provocateurs of murder! Re pay our debts of blood! Repay our debts of blood!
 
We thus ask the people in this grave moment to maintain calm and wisdom. The people will fight the authorities to the bitter end or perish

Ten years after the Central European revolutions of 1989, what more do we know? Above all, we know more about the consequences. We can now say that these events had results that place 1989 beside 1789 as a date in world history. Not only was the peaceful revolution that leapt from Poland to Hungary to Germany to Czechoslovakia the beginning of a swift and fundamental change of system in the countries of Central Europe. 1989 also meant the end of the cold war, which had started in the 1940s over these same countries. As a result it directly affected many other regions of the world, such as Southern Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, whose politics had been deformed by the global competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, cap-italism and communism, “East” and “West.” In fact, it is difficult to find a country in the world that was untouched by the end of the cold war.
 
Moreover, what happened in Central Europe in 1989 hastened the end of the Soviet Union. Just a few months later, the Baltic states declared their independence. In Central Europe, Gorbachev and his colleagues had been robbed of the precious illusion that ’89 could be a happier replay of the Prague Spring of ’68, with reformist leaderships building “socialism with a human face” in Prague, Berlin, Warsaw, and Budapest. Now they were swiftly deprived of another illusion. In relation to the Soviet Union’s external empire, in what was then usually called Eastern Europe, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov had wittily enunciated a replacement for the old Brezhnev Doctrine. He called it the Sinatra Doctrine, slightly misquoting the old crooner: “You do it your way,” he said. However, the Gorbachev leadership still thought the Sinatra Doctrine could be applied to the extended empire but denied to the internal empire—that is, to the constituent parts of the Soviet Union itself. Where the Baltic states led, the republics of the Transcaucasus, Ukraine, and, most important, Russia under Boris Yeltsin would follow.
 
The connection of the velvet revolutions to the collapse of Europe’s other communist multiethnic federation, Yugoslavia, is less direct. Here, Slobodan Milosevic was stripping Kosovo of its autonomy even as the Poles gathered at their round table. The destruction of Tito’s country had its own fearsome internal dynamic. Yet the end of communism in Central Europe certainly precipitated the end of the party that had held Yugoslavia together. The Yugoslav League of Communists was effectively dissolved at its Fourteenth Special Congress in January 1990. It is hard to imagine the subsequent bloody dismemberment of Yugoslavia unfolding in the same way if there had still been a global competition between East and West.
 
Nineteen eighty-nine also caused, throughout the world, a profound crisis of identity on what had been known since the French Revolution of 1789 as “the left.” It prompted many to ask the question pithily formulated by the political philosopher Steven Lukes: “What’s left?” What’s left of the left, that is, if there is no more utopian project? There have been some interesting ironies in the ensuing debate.
 
Take the “third way,” for example. It was the illusions of Gorbachev and his team about the possibilities of a “third way” between old-style communism and capitalism that made the revolutions in Central Europe possible. If they had not believed that reform communists—new Alexander Dubceks—had a chance of building systems different from those in the West as well as the old East, they would not have encouraged the Polish, Hungarian, and subsequently East German and Czechoslovak leaders on the road that led so rapidly from reform to revolution—or at least to what I christened in these pages at the time as “refolution” (i.e., a new mixture of reform and revolution).
The anticommunist leaders of those revolutions insisted, by contrast, that there was no such “third way.” Coming to power, they immediately reached for the existing Western models of a free market economy, democracy, and the rule of law. Yet in 1999, world leaders of the vaguely center-left, including the American president Bill Clinton, the British prime minister Tony Blair, the German chancellor Gerhard Schröder, and the Italian prime minister Massimo d’Alema (a former communist), came together at an extraordinary meeting in Washington to celebrate their new ideology. And what did they call it? “The third way”! By this they meant, however, only a more socially-minded version of reformed capitalism.
 
Another irony is the way the end of Marxist regimes in Europe has contributed to a revival of Marxist analysis. It is not just old Marxists who have pointed out that the raw, early capitalism of the postcommunist world re-calls that described by Karl Marx. In Poland’s new private firms, for example, there are virtually no trade unions. The new entrepreneurs like to negotiate individually with each employee. It’s each man for himself. As importantly, the relentless globalization of the world capitalist economy—to which the end of the cold war certainly contributed—has made some of Marx’s analytical insights (although not his solutions) seem more rather than less relevant. “In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency,” Marx and Engels wrote in The Communist Manifesto, “we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.” Well, one hundred and fifty years later, we do; as the result of an anticommunist revolution.
 
If we know more about the consequences, we also know more about the causes. Ten years on we already have most of the internal documents for which, in the case of the Russian Revolution of 1917, we had to wait more than seventy years. These richly augment the eyewitness account of the Central European revolutions I gave in my book The Magic Lantern, and those of others present at the time. Thus Czech sources add many interesting facts about the beginning of the velvet revolution in Prague which were not available when I wrote about it. For example, we now know that the student who was at first reported to have been killed in the November 17 demonstration was actually a secret police agent called Ludvik Zifcak. Earlier this year, I interviewed him for a BBC television series on the experience of the ten years since the revolutions. Now a pawnbroker in the remote Moravian town of Bruntal, Zifcak confirmed that he had orders to “die” that day, while other secret police agents—also posing as students—spread the news of his death to Western media. The idea was to provoke a little local unrest, which would give more dynamic communist leaders a pretext to take power. This is one of relatively few cases where behind a conspiracy theory you find a real conspiracy—although one that went rapidly and gloriously wrong. They hoped, as he told me, to save communism; in fact, they precipitated its demise.
 
Meanwhile, the passage of time produces its own peculiar distortions. One thing that happened rather quickly in the early 1990s was that history was rewritten—not in the deliberate, Orwellian way of communist states, but through the much more subtle, spontaneous, and potent workings of human memory. Suddenly Western politicians “remembered” how they had all along predicted the end of communism. Suddenly almost everyone in the East had been some sort of dissident. The ranks of the opposition grew miraculously after the event. Former communist leaders also produced remarkable memories. Thus, in conversations after German unification, both the former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Aleksander Yakovlev, a key Gorbachev adviser, told me that they had anticipated it as early as the mid-1980s. Was there a record of that? Well no, you see, they could not have said this out loud, not even to a small group of officials—because to do so might have shaken the whole fabric of Moscow’s relations with Eastern Europe. (And the difficulty for the historian is that this is also true.)
 
Meanwhile, newly opened archives disgorged more evidence of the hidden weaknesses of the communist states. This was immediately added to the rapidly growing pile of reasons for believing that the Soviet empire was bound to collapse when it did. A good example is the revelation about East Germany’s soaring hard currency debt, which had been treated as top secret, and which it was barely able to service from month to month. It emerged that there was a louche Stasi colonel called Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski who was selling to the West everything that would move—old paintings, jewelry, guns—in a desperate attempt to pay next week’s interest.
 
“Aha!” politicians and journalists exclaimed. “East Germany was bound to collapse in 1989 because it was bankrupt.” Now these were interesting revelations. Knowing that they were up to their ears in debt to the capitalist West certainly would not have encouraged East German leaders to fight to defend their regime against the aspirations of its own people. But so secret was the information that most East German leaders didn’t know it either. They were victims of their own lies. In any case, states do not simply go bankrupt, like companies. In extremis, they default on their debts, as Latin American countries did. Yet so long as the Soviet Union was prepared to use force to hang on to its East European empire, and so long as West Germany was prepared to go on lending more money in order to keep East Germany “stable,” the bankrupt state could have continued.
 
You can always find more than sufficient causes for every great event—after the event. Certainly there were major structural causes of what happened in 1989. Not the least of these was the widening economic gap between East and West, a gap which détente policies did enable ordinary East Europeans to appreciate and resent. But we must beware of what Henri Bergson called “the illusions of retrospective determinism.” Interpretations that present the events and outcome of 1989 as inevitable are probably further from the truth than we were at the time, in our heady cloud of unknowing.
 
The truth is that 1989 could have turned bloody at any point, as China did on the very same day as the historic Polish elections, June 4. In Warsaw, we watched the first pictures from Tiananmen Square while waiting for the election results. “Tiananmen” was a word that I would hear muttered many times in Central and East European capitals over the next few months. What made the difference in Europe was two sets of political leaders: the opposition elites, and the Gorbachev group in Moscow. 1989 was further proof of the vital importance of individuals in history.
 
I doubt that there are many factual revelations about 1989 still lurking in the archives. What remains is the unending battle of interpretations. 1989 has had its share of this over the last decade. It has been called “the end of history” by Francis Fukuyama but the return of history by his critics. The Yale political scientist Bruce Ackerman sees it as a test case for “liberal revolution.” The famous German sociologist Jürgen Habermas has described it as a nachholende Revolution, a “catching-up revolution.” An American writer, George Weigel, has even celebrated it as “an embodiment of the final revolution,” which, in case you were wondering, is “the human turn to the good, to the truly human—and ultimately to God.” Others, including the distinguished historian of the French Revolution François Furet, have argued that it was not really a revolution at all. Furet maintained that the Central European events were merely side effects of what was happening in Russia, and, in ideological content and final effect, more like a restoration.
 
One claim I made in the last chapter of The Magic Lantern has been the subject of controversy. This is my assertion that the revolutionaries, or postrevolutionaries, brought to the new Europe of the 1990s “no fundamentally new ideas.” (That was, incidentally, another reason Furet gave for not considering it to be a proper revolution.) I have been challenged on this by old friends and participants in the revolutions, such as the Czech philosopher Martin Palous. However, they have not yet managed to reveal to me what major new idea about the arrangement of human society emerged from 1989.
 
Instead, some of those things that were pointed to in the immediate aftermath as possible candidates for the title—for example, a new style of “forum” or “civic movement” politics, as opposed to old-style Western party politics, with its sterile battles between left and right—soon disappeared, to be replaced by local versions of arrangements to be found already somewhere else in the world. These countries now all have conventional, Western-style party politics, although the composition and character of their political parties is, of course, unique. They often can be explained only by taking account of pre-1989 political constellations: for example, post-Solidarity parties versus the post-communist party in Poland. It is perhaps an irony that revolutions led by intellectuals should produce no new ideas—only new realities. I compared 1989 to 1848, but in this respect it was the opposite of 1848.
 
Yet perhaps this is to look in the wrong place. For the great new idea of this revolution was the revolution itself. It was not the “what” but the “how,” not the end but the means. The new idea of 1989 was nonrevolutionary revolution. In talking of these events, the word “revolution” has always to be qualified with an adjective—“peaceful,” or “evolutionary,” or “self-limiting,” or “velvet”—because the leaders of the popular movements deliberately set out to do something different from the classic revolutionary model, as it developed from 1789, through 1917, right up to the Hungarian revolution of 1956. As I remember people actually discussing at the time in the Magic Lantern theater in Prague, an essential part of earlier revolutions had been revolutionary violence. Here, there was a conscious effort to avoid it.
 
The motto of these revolutions might come from Lenin’s great critic, the reformist Eduard Bernstein: “The goal is nothing, the movement is everything.” The fundamental insight underlying the actions of the opposition elites, born of their own Central European learning process since 1945, but also of a deeper reflection on the history of revolution since 1789, was that you cannot separate ends from means. The methods you adopt determine the outcome you will achieve. You cannot lie your way through to the truth. As Adam Michnik memorably put it: those who start by storming Bastilles will end up building new Bastilles.
 
The 1989 model combines an absolute insistence on nonviolence with the active, highly inventive use of mass civil disobedience, skillful appeals to Western media, public opinion, and governments, and a readiness to negotiate and compromise with the power-holders, while refusing to be co-opted by them. It embraces occupation strikes and peaceful demonstrations, but also secret talks. The pressure of public protest is brought to bear, through an opposition elite, for the purpose of a peaceful transfer of power by dialogue and compromise. If the symbol of 1789 was the guillotine, that of 1989 is the round table.
 
This model may not have been imitated in its entirety elsewhere, but it has certainly had an impact. In South Africa, leaders from all sides told me that their own peaceful, negotiated transition was profoundly influenced by what happened in Europe in 1989. I know that the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has closely studied the velvet revolutions, although she still looks in vain for her partner among those in power. Is it too fanciful to see an indirect influence of 1989 even in Northern Ireland?
 
In Central Europe itself, there has proved to be one major problem with the 1989 model. Just because the change was peaceful and negotiated, people have missed a sense of revolutionary catharsis. Moreover, a negotiated transfer of power requires compromise. There has to be something in it for those who are surrendering power. For many members of the former ruling class, the nomenklatura, in 1989, that “something” was the prospect of setting themselves up in private business, with the start-up capital coming from hastily privatized or, frankly, misappropriated state property. In this “privatization of the nomenklatura” they appeared to be trading political for economic power. But then the postcommunist parties, with their nationwide activists and offices, and old and new funds, also proved remarkably successful in the democratic competition for political power. The result has been a widespread sense of frustration. If you travel through Central Europe today, you will be told again and again by ordinary men and women that “the same people are still on top,” that the communists have become the worst capitalists, that “more should have been done” to make a reckoning with the past.
 
Germany, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have all wrestled with this problem of the past. The Germans tried a comprehensive reckoning: trials, purges after vetting, a parliamentary commission, the opening of the Stasi files. The Czechs tried a purge, politely called “lustration.” The Poles initially wanted to let bygones be bygones, like Spain after Franco. The country’s first noncommunist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, famously talked of drawing a “thick line” between the present and the past. But they found it didn’t work. Issues of lustration and the opening of secret police files plague Polish politics to this day.
 
I have written about this problem extensively in my two most recent books, The File and History of the Present. Here, I would say just two things. First, the problem is unavoidable. It is intrinsic to the path chosen. Second, I believe, with benefit of hindsight, that all the countries of Central Europe could and should have tried the expedient of a truth commission—although without involving it in the quasi-judicial business of granting or refusing amnesty, as happened in South Africa. A truth commission, before which the political leaders of the former regime and those accused of crime under it have to testify, brings both greater public knowledge of the misdeeds of the past and a formal, almost ceremonial acknowledgement to the victims. It symbolically draws a line between the new era and the old, without calling for forgetting or even, necessarily, forgiving. It is probably the closest a nonrevolutionary revolution can come to revolutionary catharsis.
 
So if I were to be asked to note on a postcard the ingredients of the new model revolution, I would say: peaceful mass civil disobedience, channeled by an opposition elite; attention and pressure from the outside world; a transition negotiated though compromises made at a round table; and then a truth commission.
 
Even without this last element, the revolutions in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, and Prague have, we can now say, succeeded. On the penultimate page of The Magic Lantern, written in early 1990, I speculated as follows:
 
You can, alas, paint with a rather high degree of analytical plausibility a quite dark picture of the prospect for the former Eastern Europe in the 1990s: a prospect in which the postcommunist future looks remarkably like the pre-communist past, less Central Europe than Zwischeneuropa, a dependent intermediate zone of weak states, national prejudice, inequality, poverty and Schlamassel. 1989 might then appear, to participants and historians, as just one brief shining moment between the sufferings of yesterday and those of tomorrow.
 
For all the popular frustration and widespread disappointment, those fears have definitely not become a reality in the heartlands of Central Europe. At the same time, things much, much worse than I imagined have happened elsewhere in postcommunist Europe—above all, in former Yugoslavia. What has characterized the postcommunist world has been this great divergence, so that the political distance between Prague and Pristina is now much greater than that between Paris and Prague.
In the whole spectrum of postcommunist countries, those whose revolutions I wrote about in the early 1990s—Poland, Hungary, Germany, and what is now the Czech Republic—stand out as the only four that have clearly, beyond any reasonable doubt, already made the transition to something approaching the Western normality of freedom, market economy, democracy, and the rule of law. (I assume Havel’s velvet revolution to be primarily a phenomenon of the Czech lands. Slovakia had to pass through the dark valley of Vladimir Meciar’s semiauthoritarian regime before having its own belated “catching-up revolution” in 1998.)
 
Is it a coincidence that these were the only four to have what can properly be called velvet revolutions? Bulgaria had a transition so velvet that it left the postcommunists in power; Romania’s was violent, but also left postcommunists in power. Doesn’t this prove that the opposition leaders were right in their fundamental insight that the means would determine the end? But of course you could say that they only had these velvet revolutions because they had these elites. And you could say they had these elites because their countries had been, historically, closer to the West, with Western Christianity, a developed civil society, and so on. So you could attribute their subsequent success rather to these deeper historical factors: to their geographical proximity to the West, and, indeed, to the fact that the West favored them politically and economically—inasmuch as it favored anybody—in its post-1989 policy. Like all arguments about historical causation, this one can never be resolved with certainty. Nonetheless, I don’t believe that the great givens of geography and history predetermined the emergence of the extraordinary people I wrote about in 1989. Nor was it inevitable that they would adopt methods which, at least in this combination, had never been tried before. Nor, having adopted these methods, was it inevitable that they would succeed.
 
“All revolutions are failures,” said Orwell. “But they are not all the same failure.” This one was the exception. But that is because it was unlike all earlier revolutions.
