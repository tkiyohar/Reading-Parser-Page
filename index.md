The End of the Cold War
How did decolonization and the end of the Cold War change Europe? In the late 1960s and early 1970s the United States and the Soviet Union pursued a relaxation of Cold War tensions that became known as détente (day-TAHNT). But détente stalled when Brezhnev’s Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to save an unpopular Marxist regime. détente The progressive relaxation of Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The United States reacted with alarm to the spread of Soviet influence. Ronald Reagan (U.S. pres. 1981–1989) sought to halt the spread of Soviet influence, much like predecessors John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman had. But as Reagan and conservative allies in Europe rekindled the Cold War, the Soviet Union began reforms that culminated in the release of control over eastern Europe and the dismantling of the Soviet Union and its Communist state. The Limits of Reform in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe After their 1968 intervention in Czechoslovakia, Soviet leaders worked to restore order and stability. Free expression and open protest disappeared throughout their satellite nations. A rising standard of living helped ensure stability as well. Beneath this appearance of stability, however, the Soviet Union underwent a social revolution. The urban population expanded rapidly. The number of highly trained professionals increased fourfold between 1960 and 1985. The education that created expertise helped foster the growth of Soviet public opinion about questions ranging from pollution to urban transportation. When Mikhail Gorbachev (b. 1931) became premier in 1985, he set out to reform the Soviet system with policies he called democratic socialism. The first set of reforms was intended to transform and restructure the economy. Perestroika permitted freer prices, more autonomy for state enterprises, and the establishment of some profitseeking private cooperatives. A more far-reaching campaign of openness, or glasnost, introduced in 1985, allowed significant new space for public debate by increasing transparency and allowing a more open media.

Democratization under Gorbachev led to the first free elections in the Soviet Union since 1917. Gorbachev and the party remained in control, but an independent minority was elected in 1989 to a revitalized Congress of People’s Deputies. Democratization encouraged demands for greater autonomy from non-Russian minorities, especially in the Baltic region and in the Caucasus. Finally, Gorbachev brought “new political thinking” to foreign affairs. He withdrew Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1989 and sought to reduce Cold War tensions. Gorbachev pledged to respect the political choices of eastern Europe’s peoples. Soon after, a wave of peaceful revolutions swept across eastern Europe, overturning Communist regimes. Poland led the way. In August 1980 strikes grew into a working-class revolt. Led by Lech Wałęsa (lehk vah-LEHN-suh) (b. 1943), workers organized the independent trade union Solidarity. Communist leaders responded by imposing martial law in December 1981 and arresting Solidarity’s leaders. By 1988 labor unrest and inflation had brought Poland to the brink of economic collapse, pressuring Poland’s Communist Party leaders into legalizing Solidarity and allowing free elections in 1989 for some seats in the Polish parliament. Solidarity won every contested seat. A month later Solidarity member Tadeusz Mazowiecki (mah-zoh-VYEHTskee) (1927–2013) was sworn in as the first noncommunist prime minister in eastern Europe in a generation. Solidarity Led by Lech Wałęsa, an independent Polish trade union organized in 1980 that worked for the rights of workers and political reform. Czechoslovakia and Romania reflected different paths to reform: Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution led to the peaceful ouster of Communist leaders amid massive street protests led by students and intellectuals. (See “Individuals in Society: Václav Havel,” at right.) But in Romania the revolution was violent. Communist dictator

Nicolae Ceauşescu (chow-SHEHS-koo) (1918–1989) unleashed his security forces on protesters, sparking an armed uprising. After Ceauşescu’s forces were defeated, he and his wife were captured and executed by a military court. Amid the transformation of eastern Europe, Germany reunified. Reunification began with the millions of East Germans who flooded across their country’s borders to reach West Germany (see Map 31.1). As neighboring countries liberalized, East Germany’s leaders gave in to public pressure and opened the Berlin Wall in November 1989, before being swept aside. An “Alliance for Germany” won general elections and negotiated an economic union with West Germany. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl reassured American, Soviet, and European leaders that a reunified Germany would have peaceful intentions. Within the year, East and West Germany merged into a single nation under West Germany’s constitution and laws. Many people in eastern Europe faced unexpected hardships in the process of liberalization as economies underwent difficult transformations and the state infrastructure of social welfare crumbled. But the greatest postcommunist tragedy was in Yugoslavia, whose federation of republics and regions had been held together under Josip Tito’s Communist rule. After Tito’s death in 1980, rising territorial and ethnic tensions were intensified by economic decline.

Within a year the wall was torn down, communism collapsed, and the Cold War ended. The revolutions of 1989 accelerated the breakup of Yugoslavia. Serbian president Slobodan Milošević (SLOH-buh-dayn muh-LOH-suhvihch) (1941–2006) attempted to grab land from other republics to create a “greater Serbia.” His ambitions led to civil wars that between 1991 and 2001 engulfed Kosovo, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina (Map 32.2). In 1999 Serbian aggression prompted NATO air strikes, led by the United States, against the Serbian capital of Belgrade as well as against Serbian military forces until Milošević relented. Milošević was voted out of office in 2000. The new Serbian government extradited him to a United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands to stand trial for crimes

against humanity as peace was restored to the former Yugoslav republics. MAP 32.2 The Breakup of Yugoslavia Yugoslavia had the most ethnically diverse population in eastern Europe. The Republic of Croatia had substantial Serbian and Muslim minorities, and Bosnia-Herzegovina had large Muslim, Serbian, and Croatian populations, none of which had a majority. In June 1991 Serbia’s brutal effort to seize territory and unite all Serbs in a single state brought a tragic civil war to the region.

INDIVIDUALS IN SOCIETY
Václav Havel
Václav Havel, playwright, dissident leader, and the first postcommunist president of the Czech Republic. ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 24, 1989, the revolution in Czechoslovakia reached its climax. Three hundred thousand people had poured into Prague’s historic Wenceslas Square to continue the massive protests that had erupted a week earlier after the police savagely beat student demonstrators. Now all eyes were focused on a high balcony. There an elderly man with a gentle smile and a middle-aged intellectual wearing jeans and a sports jacket stood arm in arm and acknowledged the cheers of the crowd. “Dubček-Havel,” the people roared.

“Dubček-Havel!” Alexander Dubček, who represented the failed promise of reform communism in the 1960s (see “The World in 1968” in Chapter 31), was symbolically passing the torch to Václav Havel, who embodied the uncompromising opposition to communism that was sweeping the country. That very evening, the hard-line Communist government resigned, and soon Havel was the unanimous choice to head a new democratic Czechoslovakia. Who was this man to whom the nation turned in 1989? Born in 1936 into a prosperous, cultured, upper-middle-class family, the young Havel was denied admission to the university because of his class origins. Loving literature and philosophy, he gravitated to the theater, became a stagehand, and emerged in the 1960s as a leading playwright. His plays were set in vague settings, developed existential themes, and poked fun at the absurdities of life and the pretensions of communism. In his private life, Havel thrived on good talk, Prague’s lively bar scene, and officially forbidden rock ’n’ roll. In 1968 the Soviets rolled into Czechoslovakia, and Havel watched in horror as a tank commander opened fire on a crowd of peaceful protesters in a small town. “That week,” he recorded, “was an experience I shall never forget.”* The free-spirited artist threw himself into the intellectual opposition to communism and became its leading figure for the next twenty years. The costs of defiance were enormous. Purged and blacklisted, Havel lifted barrels in a brewery and wrote bitter satires that could not be staged. In 1977 he and a few other dissidents publicly protested Czechoslovakian violations of human rights, and in 1989 this Charter ’77 group became the inspiration for Civic Forum, the democratic coalition that toppled communism. Havel spent five years in prison and was constantly harassed by the police. Havel’s thoughts and actions focused on truth, decency, and moral regeneration. In 1975, in a famous open letter to Czechoslovakia’s Communist boss, Havel wrote that the people were indeed quiet, but only because they were “driven by fear… . Everyone has something to lose and so everyone has reason to be afraid.” Havel saw lies, hypocrisy, and apathy undermining and poisoning all human relations in his country:
“Order has been established — at the price of a paralysis of the spirit, a deadening of the heart, and a spiritual and moral crisis in society.”† Yet Havel saw a way out of the Communist quagmire. He argued that a profound but peaceful revolution in human values was possible. Such a revolution could lead to the moral reconstruction of Czech and Slovak society, where, in his words, “values like trust, openness, responsibility, solidarity and love” might again flourish and nurture the human spirit.

Havel was a voice of hope and humanity who inspired his compatriots with a lofty vision of a moral postcommunist society. As president of his country from 1989 to 2003, Havel continued to speak eloquently on the great questions of our time. QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS 1. Why did Havel oppose Communist rule? How did his goals differ from those of Dubček and other advocates of reform communism? 2. Havel has been called a “moralist in politics.” Is this a good description of him? Why or why not? *Quoted in M. Simmons, The Reluctant President: A Political Life of Václav Havel (London: Methuen, 1991), p. 91. †Quoted ibid., p. 110.

Recasting Russia Without Communism
In February 1990 the Soviet Communist Party was defeated in local elections throughout the country, eroding Gorbachev’s power and strengthening his rival, Boris Yeltsin (1931–2007), the former mayor of Moscow. In May 1990, as leader of the Russian parliament, Yeltsin announced that Russia would declare its independence from the Soviet Union. In August 1991 Gorbachev faced an attempted coup by Communist hardliners who wanted to preserve a Communist Soviet Union. Instead their coup attempt hastened the end of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin emerged as a popular hero for his dramatic resistance: at one point, he climbed atop a tank deployed by the conspirators to deliver a rousing speech calling for a general strike in resistance to the coup. In the aftermath of the attempted takeover, an anticommunist revolution swept the Russian Federation. The Communist Party was outlawed and its property confiscated. Yeltsin and his liberal allies declared Russia independent and withdrew from the Soviet Union. All the other Soviet republics followed suit. Gorbachev agreed to their independence, and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on December 25, 1991 (Map 32.3). The newly independent post-Soviet republics faced challenges, including the need to quickly build new political systems and the urgency of economic reforms meant to open socialist economies to free-market principles. Liberal reforms doomed much of Russia’s industry, and its economy depended increasingly on oil and natural gas exports. Despite its weakened economy, Russia retained the world’s second-largest nuclear arsenal, as well as a powerful vote (and veto) in the United Nations Security Council.

MAP 32.3 Russia and the Successor States After the attempt in August 1991 to depose Gorbachev failed, an anticommunist revolution swept the Soviet Union. Led by Russia and Boris Yeltsin, the republics that formed the Soviet Union declared their sovereignty and independence. Eleven of the fifteen republics then formed a loose confederation called the Commonwealth of Independent States, but the integrated economy of the Soviet Union dissolved into separate national economies, each with its own goals and policies. As Yeltsin presided over newly independent Russia, he opted for breakneck liberalization. This shock therapy, which followed methods similar to radical free-market policies in Chile and other parts of Latin America, freed prices on most goods and launched a rapid privatization of industry. Prices soared and production collapsed. State industrial monopolies became private monopolies that cut production and raised prices in order to maximize profits. The quality of public services and health care declined to the point that the average male life expectancy dropped from sixty-nine years in 1991 to fifty-nine years in 2007. In 2003 Russia’s per capita income was lower than at any time since 1978. The election of Yeltsin’s handpicked successor, President Vladimir Putin (b. 1952), in 2000 ushered in a new era of “managed democracy.” Putin’s stress on public order and economic reform was popular, even as

he became progressively more authoritarian. Significant restrictions were placed on media freedoms, regional elections were abolished, and the distinction between judicial and executive authority collapsed. Putin consolidated the power and authority of the state around himself and his closest advisers, closing off the development of democratic pluralism and an independent legal system in Russia. Putin’s illiberal tendencies were also evident in his brutal military campaign against Chechnya (CHEHCH-nyuh), a tiny republic of 1 million Muslims in southern Russia (see Map 32.3, inset) that in 1991 declared its independence. Up to two hundred thousand Chechen civilians are estimated to have been killed between 1994 and 2011. Many more became refugees. Chechen resistance to Russian domination continued, often in the form of attacks such as a suicide bombing at Moscow’s airport in 2011 that killed scores of travelers. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, political and ethnic divisions threatened peace and stability among the post-Soviet republics. In Ukraine, in 2014 pro-Western protesters toppled a president who refused to sign agreements with the European Union. In the aftermath of the uprising, Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian province of Crimea along the Black Sea and backed secessionist movements in ethnically Russian regions of Ukraine. Russia’s seizure of Crimea undermined the terms under which the Soviet Union had dissolved into separate republics, provoking unease among other new states such as the Baltic republics.
