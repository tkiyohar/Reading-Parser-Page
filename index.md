Latin America: Dictatorship, Debt, and
Democratization
What effect did the Cold War and debt crisis have on Latin America? After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the United States financed and armed military dictatorships to suppress any dissent that might lead to communism and to secure U.S. influence in the region. Many elected governments were toppled in military coups that brought right-wing military dictatorships to power with U.S. military and financial support. Civil Wars in Central America Central America experienced the greatest violence in Latin America during the Cold War. In the second half of the twentieth century reformers in Central America sought economic development that was less dependent on the United States and U.S. corporations, and groups of peasants and urban workers began to press for political rights and improved living standards. Through the lens of the Cold War, Central American conservatives and the U.S. government saw these nationalists, peasants, and workers as Communists who should be suppressed. In turn, many workers and peasants radicalized and formed Marxist revolutionary movements. The result of this conflict, and of U.S. support for right-wing governments, officers, and paramilitary groups, was hundreds of thousands of deaths. In Guatemala, after reformist president Jacobo Arbenz was deposed in 1954 by a military coup organized by the CIA, subsequent Guatemalan leaders, backed by the U.S. government, violently suppressed peasant movements, killing over two hundred thousand mostly indigenous people. In 2013 former dictator José Efraín Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide against Maya communities, though the Guatemalan Constitutional Court annulled the conviction. Genocide in Guatemala’s Civil War The United Nations declared the systematic killing of indigenous Guatemalans during the country’s civil war an act of genocide. In recent years investigators have worked to identify victims of the government’s violence, such as six people who disappeared in 1982, whose remains have been returned to their community for burial. El Salvador and Nicaragua, too, faced civil wars. In 1979 the Sandinista movement overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas, who conducted a revolutionary transformation of Nicaragua inspired by Communist rule in Cuba, were undermined by war with a U.S.-trained and U.S.-financed insurgent army called the Contras. In El Salvador a right-wing death squad killed Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980 for speaking out against their violence. U.S. policies that encouraged one faction to fight against the other deepened political instability and repression and intensified these civil wars. Acting against U.S. wishes, Costa Rican president Oscar Arias mediated peace talks in 1986 among the warring factions in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala, which ended the wars and initiated open elections in each country, with former armed rivals competing instead at the ballot box. Peace did not bring prosperity, and in the decades following the end of the civil wars both poverty and violence have remained intense, prompting many Central Americans to seek opportunity in Mexico and the United States. Boom and Bust in Chile In the 1960s Chilean voters pushed for greater social reforms, culminating in the election of the Marxist candidate Salvador Allende (ah-YEHN-day) as president in 1970. Allende redistributed land and nationalized foreign businesses, including the country’s vast copper mines, drawing fiery opposition from conservative Chileans, foreign businesses, and the U.S. government. Allende used mining revenue to pay for housing, education, health care, and other social welfare projects. U.S. president Richard Nixon created a clandestine task force to organize an “invisible blockade” to disrupt the Chilean economy by withholding economic aid and quietly instructing U.S. companies not to trade with or invest in Chile. Nixon instructed his task force to “make [Chile’s] economy scream.” In 1973 Chile’s armed forces deposed Allende, who killed himself when the military stormed the presidential palace. A junta, or council of commanders of the branches of the armed forces, took power. Its leader, General Augusto Pinochet (peen-oh-CHEHT) (1915–2006), instituted radical economic reforms, giving neoliberal economists a free hand to conduct what they called “shock treatment” to remake Chile as a freemarket economy. Schools, health care, pensions, and public services were turned over to private companies. Regulatory protections for industry were slashed, and land was concentrated into the hands of large agricultural corporations. The U.S. government lavished Pinochet with economic aid. junta A government headed by a council of commanders of the branches of the armed forces. The reforms created a boom-and-bust cycle in which Chile became especially vulnerable to global economic changes. At its peak, Chile’s economy grew at 8 percent per year. The costs of the reforms were just as intense. Income inequality soared: a handful of Chileans tied to big business conglomerates and banks made fortunes, while workers faced job loss and an increasing cost of living. In 1975 the implementation of reforms that cut social programs and caused mass unemployment left half of the country’s children malnourished. The 1982 recession in Chile put one-third of Chileans out of work. Under Pinochet, thousands of Chileans disappeared, and tens of thousands were tortured. These abuses brought international condemnation and resistance within Chile. Women who had lost relatives gathered under the protection of the Catholic Church and embroidered quilts known as arpilleras, rendering images of their missing relatives or experiences with repression. Catholic leaders used the church’s privileged position to investigate human rights abuses, uncovering mass graves that served as proof of the dictatorship’s violence. Amid the excesses of Pinochet’s dictatorship, opponents and even many allies looked for ways to curb his power and find the path for redemocratization. After the 1982 economic crisis, businessmen joined opposition groups such as the Catholic Church to press for liberalization. These groups formed a coalition called Concertación, which proposed a return to democracy that maintained the major elements of free-market reforms. Concertación called on Chileans to vote “NO” in a 1988 plebiscite on whether Pinochet would remain in power. The “NO” vote won, and Chile held its first democratic elections in two decades. The opposition alliance in Chile resembled many other alliances around the world that sought transitions from authoritarian rule: political opponents who advocated for human rights joined forces with business groups that sought markets in order to produce a postdictatorship democracy founded on free-market principles and support for human rights. The Dirty War in Argentina The Argentine military intervened repeatedly in politics for decades after it deposed populist Juan Perón in 1955 (see “Populism in Argentina and Brazil” in Chapter 31). By 1973 the armed forces conceded that their efforts to erase Perón’s legacy — to “de-Perónize” the country — had failed. They allowed Perón to return, and he was again elected president, with his wife Isabelita, a political novice, as vice president. Soon after the election, Juan Perón died. Isabelita Perón, the first woman to become president in Latin America, faced daunting circumstances: Marxist groups such as the Montoneros waged a guerrilla war against the regime, while the armed forces and death squads waged war on them. In March 1976 a military junta took power and announced a Process of National Reorganization. Influenced by French military theorists who had been stung by their defeats in guerrilla wars in Vietnam and Algeria, the generals waged a “dirty war,” seeking to kill and “disappear” people whom they considered a destructive “cancer” on the nation. Between fourteen and thirty thousand Argentines perished at the hands of the armed forces during the dirty war. A handful of mothers whose children had disappeared began appearing in the Plaza de Mayo in front of the presidential palace holding pictures of their missing children and carrying signs reading “Where are they?” A growing organization of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo was soon joined by the Grandmothers, who demanded the whereabouts of children born to women who were detained and disappeared while pregnant. These mothers were only kept alive until they gave birth. Their children were placed with adoptive families tied to the police or armed forces. Unlike in Chile and Brazil, in Argentina senior Catholic clergy did not advocate for human rights or the protection of dissidents. Instead Argentine bishops praised the coup and defended the military regime until it ended in 1983. The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo In a protest in Buenos Aires, mothers and grandmothers demand information about their children and grandchildren who were “disappeared” by the Argentine military junta. In 1982, emboldened by its success in eradicating its opposition, the Argentine junta occupied a set of islands off its southern coast that were claimed by Britain. Known in Britain as the Falklands and in Argentina as the Malvinas, the islands were home to a small British settlement. Britain resisted the invasion, and the Falklands/Malvinas War resulted in a humiliating defeat for the Argentine junta. After the war the junta abruptly called for elections, and a civilian president took office in 1983. The new president, Raúl Alfonsín, faced a debt crisis similar to Mexico’s. He also struggled to find justice for the crimes committed by the junta. Prosecution and conviction of the junta leaders created a backlash in the armed forces: mid-ranking officers revolted out of fear that they, too, would be prosecuted, and they forced the government to halt prosecutions. Trapped by the economic and political crises, Alfonsín left office early. His successor, Carlos Menem, tried a different approach. Menem pardoned the junta members and embarked on free-market reforms, privatizing businesses and utilities and reducing trade barriers. Investment flooded in, and Argentina seemingly put the past to rest. As the capacity to attract foreign investment through privatization ran out by the end of the century, Argentina faced economic crisis again. In 2001, amid a run on banks and a collapse of the Argentine peso, the country had five different presidents in a single month. Eventually, the economy stabilized during the presidency of Néstor Kirchner, succeeded by his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Néstor Kirchner, who died in 2010 while Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was president, prosecuted those responsible for violence during the dirty war again, achieving convictions of not just the junta leaders but members of the armed forces and police who perpetrated human rights violations. Development and Dictatorship in Brazil Brazil’s military dictatorship, in power since 1964, began with liberal reforms but moved to a nationalist project of industrialization and infrastructure development that resembled some of the prescriptions of dependency theorists: increased state control of industry, restrictions on imports, and heavy investments in infrastructure. They initially achieved annual growth rates averaging 11 percent between 1968 and 1973. This growth depended on cheap imported oil and harsh political repression. When the oil embargo threatened growth, the generals borrowed heavily from abroad to subsidize fuel costs and conducted costly alternative energy projects to substitute oil with hydroelectric dams and ethanol made from sugarcane. The Brazilian cycle of borrowing petrodollars to subsidize oil imports and development projects was ruinous for the country. By the end of the 1970s Brazil had the largest foreign debt in the developing world. When the second oil shock hit in 1979 and the U.S. government raised interest rates, making Brazil’s dollar-dominated debt more expensive to manage, the country entered what became known as a “lost decade” of recession and inflation. Many workers earned less in 1989 than they had in 1980. The economic crisis set the tone for a transition to democracy: as the generals made painful cuts to public services and as Brazilians faced soaring inflation and recession, the public overwhelmingly turned against military rule and supported redemocratization. When the first civilian president took office in 1985, inflation stood at 235 percent per year and the foreign debt at $95 billion (compared to $3.2 billion when the military took power). Inflation peaked at 3,375 percent per year before being tamed by the introduction of a new currency linked to the U.S. dollar, coupled with high interest rates. As in Chile, Brazil’s transition to democracy was shaped by liberalization. Business groups, which had grown uneasy with the dictatorship’s borrowing and central planning, joined forces with human rights advocates to return the “rule of law,” rather than arbitrary rule by generals. The debt left behind by Brazil’s military leaders drove liberal economic reforms. To sustain its debt payments, the Brazilian government accepted the Washington Consensus, reducing public spending and opening the economy to imports and foreign investment. Neoliberal reforms included privatizing state enterprises, reducing protections for domestic industry against foreign competition, and keeping interest rates high to control inflation. Inflation remained low, but Brazilians faced a high cost of living, and high interest rates reduced lending to businesses and suppressed economic growth.
