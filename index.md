FEMINISM IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC WORLD

One of the major currents reshaping the United States and western Europe during the last third of the twentieth century was feminism, a critical exami nation by women of their identity and by extension their social and eco nomic roles. Feminism was not a new outlook; women on both sides of the Atlantic had been calling for greater political equality, economic opportunity, and social support since the nineteenth century. During the late 1960s femi nist sentiment flared among a new generation that had come of age within societies blessed with stability, awash in wealth, and preoccupied with human welfare. So striking were feminist achievements that young women today who might deny that they are feminists have available a rich array of opportunities and resources that simply did not exist half a century earlier.

But despite the common timing and sweeping achievements that charac terite this phase of Western feminism, strong regional variations are evident in the way that women tackled feminist issues. In the United States and Brit ain, the language of legal rights tended to dominate discussions, while in continental Europe a more theoretical approach preoccupied with differences between women and men was prominent.

Simone de Beauvoir on "What is Woman?... She is the Other"

Simone de Beauvoie's The Second Sex, published in France in 1949, foreshadowed the rise of a new feminist movement in the 1960s and early 1970s and stands as a classic of feminist writings. De Beauvoir started to write an autobiography in 1946 but found herself more and more engrossed in the issues of gender that had shaped her ide. The resulting book tackled those issues including oppression within marriage, women's control over their bodies, and the nature of domestic labor But perhaps her most important single point was the constructed nature of gen der identity Women are in effect made, she stressed, not bom. The Second Sex two volumes totaling 1.200 pages-sold 22.000 copies in its first week on the shelves, was condemned by the Catholic Church, and provoked controversy and attacks on de Beauvoir for being too politically left and too "unwomany" (she earned a Sorbonne doctorate, participated in the resistance movement during World War had an active writing career, was unmamed and childless, and was involved in a long-term relationship with philosopher and public intellectual Jean Paul Sartre). Later French feminists were respectful of de Beauvoir's work but not always in agreement with her approach. She died in 1986, having not only wit nessed but also participated in a feminist movement that her introspection had

helped begin Given the standing of the book and the pioneering nature of its analysis de Beauvoir's arguments deserve careful consideration. What claims is de Beauvoir making about gender and especially the sources of women's identity? Which ele ments seem compelling even taken for granted today and which elements seemn debatable!

From The Second Sex

1949

All agree in recognizing the fact that females exist in the human species; today as always they make up about one half of humanity. And yet we are told that femininity is in danger; we are exhorted to be women, remain women, become women. It would appear, then, that every female human being is not necessarily a woman; to be considered she must share in that mysterions and threatened reality known as femininity. Is this attribute something se creted by the ovaries? Or is its product of the philosophic imagination? Is a rustling petticoat enough to bring it down to earth?

But [t]he biological and social sciences no longer admit the existence of unchangeably fixed entities that determine given characteristics, such as those ascribed to woman, the Jew, or the Negro. Science regards any charac teristic as a reaction dependent in part upon a situation. If today femininity no longer exists, then it never existed. But does the word man, then, have no specific content?, In truth, to go for a walk with one's eyes open is enough to demonstrate that humanity is divided into two classes of individusis whose clothes, faces, bodies, smiles, gaits, interests, and occupations are manifestly different. Perhaps these differences are superficial, perhaps they are destined to disappear. What is certain is that right now they do most obviously exist.

If her fanctioning as a female is not enough to define woman, if we de cline aho to explain her through the eternal feminine," and if nevertheless we admit, provisionally, that women do exist, then we must face the question: what is a woman?

To state the question is, to me, to suggest, at once, a preliminary answer The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the notion of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: "I am a woman"; on this truth must be based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes without saying that he is a man. The terms masculine and feminine are used symmetrically only as a matter of form, as on legal papers. In actuality the relation of the two seres is not quite like that of two electrical poles, for man represents both the positive and the neutral, as is indicated by the common use of was to designate human beings in general, whereas woman represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity... Woman has ovaries, a uterus; these peculiarities im prison her in her subjectivity, circumscribe her within the limits of her own nature. It is often said that she thinks with her glands. Man superbly ignores the fact that his anatomy also includes glands, such as the testicles, and that they secrete hormones. He thinks of his body as a direct and normal connec tion with the world, which he believes he apprehends objectively, whereas he regards the body of woman as a hindrance, a prison, weighed down by every thing peculiar to it.

Thus humanity is male and man defines woman not in herself but as rela tive to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.... [S]he is simply what man decrees; thus she is called "the sex," by which is meant that she appears essentially to the male as a sexual being. For him she is sex - abso lute sex, no less. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute-she is the Other....

... Here is to be found the basic trait of woman: she is the Other in a totality of which the two components are necessary to one another.

... In truth woman has not been socially emancipated through man's need-sexual desire and the desire for offspring which makes the male dependent for satisfaction upon the female.....

... [T]he two sexes have never shared the world in equality. And even today woman is heavily handicapped, though her situation is beginning to change. Almost nowhere is her legal status the same as man's, and frequently it is much to her disadvantage. Even when her rights are legally recognized in the abstract, long-standing custom prevents their full expression in the mores. In the economic sphere men and women can almost be said to make up two castes; other things being equal, the former hold the better jobs, get higher wages, and have more opportunity for success than their new competitors. In industry and politics men have a great many more positions and they monopolise the most important posts. In addition to all this, they enjoy a traditional prestige that the education of children tends in every way to sup port, for the present enshrines the past and in the past all history has been made by men. At the present time, when women are beginning to take part in the affairs of the world, it is still a world that belongs to men- they have no doubt of it at all and women have scarcely any. To decline to be the Other, to refuse to be a party to the deal-this would be for women to renounce all the advantages conferred upon them by their alliance with the superior caste. Man-the-sovereign will provide woman-the-liege with material protection and will undertake the moral justification of her existence; thus she can evade at once both economic risk and the metaphysical risk of a liberty in which ends and aims must be contrived without assistance. Indeed, along with the ethical urge of each individual to affirm his subjective existence, there is also the temptation to forgo liberty and become a thing. This is an inauspicious road, for he who takes it-passive, lost, ruined-becomes henceforth the creature of another's will, frustrated in his transcendence and deprived of every value. But it is an easy road; on it one avoids the strain involved in undertaking an authentic existence....

...[T]here are deep similarities between the situation of woman and that of the Negro. Both are being emancipated today from a like paternalism, and  the former master class wishes to "keep them in their place"- that is, the place chosen for them. In both cases the former masters lavish more or less sincere eulogies, either on the virtues of "the good Negro" with his dormant, childish, merry soul - the submissive Negro- or on the merits of the woman who is "truly feminine". -that is, frivolous, infantile, irresponsible - the sub missive woman. In both cases the dominant class bases its argument on a state of affairs that it has itself created.... Yes, women on the whole are today inferior to men; that is, their situation affords them fewer possibilities. The question is: should that state of affairs continue? Many men hope that it will continue; not all have given up the battle. The conservative bourgeoisie still see in the emancipation of women a menace to their morality and their interests. Some men dread feminine competition.... And economic interests are not the only ones concerned. One of the benefits that oppression confers upon the oppressors is that the most humble among them is made to feel superior; thus, a "poor white" in the South can console himself with the thought that he is not a "dirty nigger"- and the more prosperous whites cleverly exploit this pride.

Similarly, the most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women....

... Here is miraculous balm for those afflicted with an inferiority com plex, and indeed no one is more arrogant towards women, more aggressive or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility....

... It is, in point of fact, a difficult matter for man to realize the extreme importance of social discriminations which seem outwardly insignificant but which produce in woman moral and intellectual effects so profound that they

appear to spring from her original nature. The most sympathetic of men never fully comprehend woman's concrete situation. And there is no reason to put much trust in the men when they rush to the defense of privileges whose full extent they can hardly measure. We shall not, then, permit ourselves to be intimidated by the number and violence of the attacks launched against women, nor to be entrapped by the self-seeking eulogies bestowed on the "true woman," nor to profit by the enthusiasm for woman's destiny manifested by men who would not for the world have any part of it......

Now, what peculiarly signalizes the situation of woman is that she-a free and autonomous being like all human creatures- nevertheless finds herself living in a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other.... How can a human being in woman's situation attain fulfillment? What roads are open to her? Which are blocked? How can independence be recovered in a state of dependency? What circumstances limit woman's lib erty and how can they be overcome? These are the fundamental questions on which I would fain throw some light. This means that I am interested in the fortunes of the individual as defined not in terms of happiness but in terms of liberty....
