Hitler and Nazism in Germany
Why were Hitler and his Nazi regime initially so popular, and how did their actions lead to World War II? The most frightening dictatorship developed in Nazi Germany. Here Nazism asserted an unlimited claim over German society and proclaimed the ultimate power of its leader, Adolf Hitler. Nazism’s aspirations were truly totalitarian. The Roots of Nazism Nazism grew out of many complex concepts, of which the most influential were extreme nationalism and racism. These ideas captured the mind of the young Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) and evolved into Nazism. Nazism A movement born of extreme nationalism and racism and dominated by Adolf Hitler from 1933 until the end of World War II in 1945. The son of an Austrian customs official, Hitler did poorly in high school and dropped out at age sixteen. He then headed to Vienna, where he was exposed to extreme Austro-German nationalists who believed Germans to be a superior people and central Europe’s natural rulers. They advocated union with Germany and violent expulsion of “inferior” peoples from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From these extremists Hitler eagerly absorbed virulent anti-Semitism, racism, and hatred of Slavs. He developed an unshakable belief in the crudest distortions of Social Darwinism (see “Science for the Masses” in Chapter 24), the superiority of Germanic races, and the inevitability of racial conflict. The Jews, he claimed, directed an international conspiracy of finance capitalism and Marxist socialism against German culture, German unity, and the German race. Anti-Semitism and racism became Hitler’s most passionate convictions. Hitler greeted the Great War’s outbreak as a salvation. The struggle and discipline of serving as a soldier in the war gave his life meaning, and when Germany suddenly surrendered in 1918, Hitler’s world was shattered. Convinced that Jews and Marxists had “stabbed Germany in the back,” he vowed to fight on. In late 1919 Hitler joined a tiny extremist group in Munich called the German Workers’ Party. By 1921 Hitler had gained absolute control of
1909
this small but growing party, now renamed the National Socialist German Worker’s Party, or Nazi Party. A master of mass propaganda and political showmanship, Hitler worked his audiences into a frenzy with wild attacks on the Versailles treaty, the Jews, war profiteers, and Germany’s Weimar Republic.
In late 1923 Germany under the Weimar Republic was experiencing unparalleled hyperinflation and seemed on the verge of collapse (see “Germany and the Western Powers” in Chapter 28). Hitler, inspired by Mussolini’s recent victory, attempted an armed uprising in Munich.
Despite the failure of the poorly organized plot and Hitler’s arrest, Nazism had been born.
Hitler’s Road to Power
At his trial Hitler violently denounced the Weimar Republic and attracted enormous publicity. During his brief prison term in 1924 he dictated Mein Kampf (My Struggle), in which he expounded on his basic ideas on race and anti-Semitism, the notion of territorial expansion based on “living space” for Germans, and the role of the leader-dictator, called the Führer (FYOOR-uhr). The Nazis remained a small splinter group until the 1929 Great Depression shattered the economic prosperity and stability of the late 1920s. By the end of 1932, 32 percent or more of Germany’s labor force was unemployed. Industrial production fell by one-half between 1929 and 1932. No factor contributed more to Hitler’s success than this economic crisis.

Young People in Hitler’s Germany This photo from 1930 shows Hitler admiring a young boy dressed in the uniform of Hitler’s storm troopers, a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that supported Hitler’s rise to power in the 1920s and early 1930s. Only a year after the founding of the storm troopers in 1921, Hitler began to organize Germany’s young people into similar paramilitary groups in an effort to militarize all of German society. The young paramilitaries became the Hitler Youth, who eventually numbered in the millions.
Hitler rejected free-market capitalism and advocated government programs to promote recovery. He pitched his speeches to middle- and lower-middle-class groups and to skilled workers. As the economy
1911
collapsed, great numbers of these people “voted their pocketbooks” 18 and deserted the conservative and moderate parties for the Nazis. In the July 1932 election the Nazis won 14.5 million votes — 38 percent of the total — and became the largest party in the Reichstag.
Hitler and the Nazis appealed strongly to German youth; Hitler himself was only forty in 1929. In 1931 almost 40 percent of Nazi Party members were under thirty, compared with 20 percent of Social Democrats.
“National Socialism is the organized will of the youth,” 19 proclaimed the official Nazi slogan. National recovery, exciting and rapid change, and personal advancement made Nazism appealing to millions of German youths.
Hitler also came to power because of the breakdown of democratic government. Germany’s economic collapse in the Great Depression convinced many voters that the country’s republican leaders were incompetent and corrupt. Disunity on the left was another nail in the republic’s coffin. The Communists refused to cooperate with the Social Democrats, even though the two parties together outnumbered the Nazis in the Reichstag.
Finally, Hitler excelled in backroom politics. In 1932 he succeeded in gaining support from key people in the army, big business, and politics, who thought they could manipulate and use him to their own advantage.
Thus in January 1933 President Paul von Hindenburg (1847–1934) legally appointed Hitler, leader of Germany’s largest party, as German chancellor.
The Nazi State and Society
Hitler quickly established an unshakable dictatorship. When the Reichstag building was partly destroyed by fire in February 1933, Hitler blamed the Communist Party. He convinced President von Hindenburg to sign dictatorial emergency acts that abolished freedom of speech and assembly and most personal liberties. He also called for new elections in an effort to solidify his political power. When the Nazis won only 44 percent of the votes, Hitler outlawed the Communist Party and arrested its parliamentary representatives. Then on March 23, 1933, the Nazis forced through the Reichstag the so-called Enabling Act, which gave Hitler absolute dictatorial power for four years. Enabling Act An act pushed through the Reichstag by the Nazis in 1933 that gave Hitler absolute dictatorial power for four years.
1912
Hitler and the Nazis took over the government bureaucracy, installing many Nazis in top positions. Hitler next outlawed strikes and abolished independent labor unions, which were replaced by the Nazi Labor Front.
Professional people — doctors and lawyers, teachers and engineers — also saw their independent organizations swallowed up in Nazi associations.
Publishing houses and universities were put under Nazi control, and students and professors publicly burned forbidden books. Modern art and architecture were ruthlessly prohibited. Life became violently antiintellectual. As the cynical Joseph Goebbels, later Nazi minister of propaganda, put it, “When I hear the word ‘culture’ I reach for my gun.”

By 1934 a brutal dictatorship characterized by frightening dynamism and total obedience to Hitler was already largely in place.
In 1934 Hitler also ordered that all civil servants and members of the German armed forces swear a binding oath of “unquestioning obedience” to Adolf Hitler. The SS — Hitler’s elite personal guard — grew rapidly.
Under Heinrich Himmler (1900–1945), the SS took over the political police (the Gestapo) and expanded its network of concentration camps.
From the beginning, German Jews were a special object of Nazi persecution. By late 1934 most Jewish lawyers, doctors, professors, civil servants, and musicians had been banned from their professions. In 1935 the infamous Nuremberg Laws classified as Jewish anyone having three or more Jewish grandparents and deprived Jews of all rights of citizenship.
By 1938 roughly one-quarter of Germany’s half million Jews had emigrated, sacrificing almost all their property in order to leave Germany.
In late 1938 the attack on the Jews accelerated and grew more violent.
On November 9 and 10, 1938, the Nazis initiated a series of wellorganized attacks against Jews throughout Nazi Germany and some parts of Austria. This infamous event is known as Kristallnacht (krees-TAHLnahkht), or Night of Broken Glass, after the broken glass that littered the streets following the frenzied destruction of Jewish homes, shops, synagogues, and neighborhoods by German civilians and uniformed storm troopers. U.S. consul David Buffum reported of the Nazis in Leipzig:
The most hideous phase of the so-called “spontaneous” action, has been the wholesale arrest and transportation to concentration camps of male German Jews between the ages of sixteen and sixty. . . . Having demolished dwellings and hurled most of the effects to the streets, the insatiably sadistic perpetrators threw many of the trembling inmates into a small stream that flows through the Zoological Park, commanding horrified spectators to spit at them, defile them with mud and jeer at their plight.
21
Many historians consider this night the beginning of Hitler’s Final
1913
Solution against the Jews, and after this event it became very difficult for Jews to leave Germany.
Some Germans privately opposed these outrages, but most went along or looked the other way. Although this lack of response reflected the individual’s helplessness in a totalitarian state, it also reflected the strong popular support Hitler’s government enjoyed.
Hitler’s Popularity
Hitler had promised the masses economic recovery — “work and bread” — and he delivered. The Nazi Party launched a large public works program to pull Germany out of the depression. In 1935 Germany turned decisively toward rearmament. Unemployment dropped steadily, and by 1938 the Nazis boasted of nearly full employment. For millions of Germans economic recovery was tangible evidence that Nazi promises were more than show and propaganda. For ordinary German citizens, in contrast to those deemed “undesirable” (Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Communists, and homosexuals), Hitler’s government offered greater equality and more opportunities. In 1933 class barriers in Germany were generally high. Hitler’s rule introduced changes that lowered these barriers. The new Nazi elite included many young and poorly educated dropouts, rootless lowermiddle-class people like Hitler who rose to the top with breathtaking speed. More generally, however, the Nazis tolerated privilege and wealth only as long as they served party needs. Yet Hitler and the Nazis failed to bring about a real social revolution. The well-educated classes held on to most of their advantages, and only a modest social leveling occurred in the Nazi years. Significantly, the Nazis shared with the Italian Fascists the stereotypical view of women as housewives and mothers. Only when facing labor shortages during the war did they reluctantly mobilize large numbers of German women for office and factory work.

Not all Germans supported Hitler, and a number of German groups actively resisted him after 1933. Tens of thousands of political enemies were imprisoned, and thousands were executed. In the first years of Hitler’s rule, the principal resisters were trade-union Communists and Socialists. Catholic and Protestant churches produced a second group of opponents. Their efforts were directed primarily at preserving genuine religious life, however, not at overthrowing Hitler. Finally, in 1938 and again during the war, some high-ranking army officers, who feared the consequences of Hitler’s reckless aggression, plotted, unsuccessfully,
1914
against him.
Aggression and Appeasement, 1933–1939
After Germany’s economic recovery and Hitler’s success in establishing Nazi control of society, Hitler turned to the next item on his agenda: aggressive territorial expansion. Germany’s withdrawal from the League of Nations in October 1933 indicated its determination to rearm. When in March 1935 Hitler established a general military draft and declared the “unequal” Versailles treaty disarmament clauses null and void, leaders in Britain, France, and Italy issued a rather tepid joint protest and warned him against future aggressive actions. But the emerging united front against Hitler quickly collapsed. Britain adopted a policy of appeasement, granting Hitler everything he could reasonably want (and more) in order to avoid war. British appeasement, which practically dictated French policy, had the support of many powerful British conservatives who, as in Germany, underestimated Hitler. The British people, still horrified by the memory, the costs, and the losses of the First World War, generally supported pacifism rather than war. Some British leaders at the time, however, such as Winston Churchill, bitterly condemned appeasement as peace at any price. After the war, British appeasement came to be viewed as “the granting from fear or cowardice of unwarranted concessions in order to buy temporary peace at someone else’s expense.” 23 Beginning in the 1990s some historians have argued that British leaders had no real choice but to appease Hitler in the 1930s, because neither Great Britain nor France was prepared psychologically or militarily to fight another war.

Italy’s Ethiopian Campaign, 1935–1936
In March 1936 Hitler marched his armies without notice into the demilitarized Rhineland, violating the Treaties of Versailles and Locarno. France would not move without British support, and Britain refused to act. As Britain and France opted for appeasement, Hitler found powerful allies, particularly Mussolini, who in October 1935 had attacked the independent African kingdom of Ethiopia. Western powers had condemned the Italian aggression, but Hitler supported Italy energetically. In October 1936 Italy and Germany established the so-called Rome-Berlin Axis. Japan, which wanted support for its occupation of Manchuria, joined the Axis alliance in 1940 (see “Japan Against China” in Chapter 29). At the same time, Germany and Italy intervened in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), where their support helped General Francisco Franco’s Fascist movement defeat republican Spain. Republican Spain’s only official aid in the fight against Franco came from the Soviet Union. In late 1937 Hitler moved forward with his plans to crush Austria and Czechoslovakia as the first step in his long-contemplated drive to the east for living space. On March 12, 1938, German armies moved into Austria unopposed, and Austria became two provinces of Greater Germany (Map 30.1).

MAP 30.1 The Growth of Nazi Germany, 1933–1939 Until March 1939 Hitler brought ethnic Germans into the Nazi state; then he turned on the Slavic peoples, whom he had always hated. He stripped Czechoslovakia of its independence and prepared for an attack on Poland in September 1939.
Simultaneously, Hitler demanded that the pro-Nazi, German-speaking territory of western Czechoslovakia — the Sudetenland — be turned over to Germany. Democratic Czechoslovakia was prepared to defend itself, but appeasement triumphed again. In September 1938 British prime minister Arthur Neville Chamberlain (1869–1940) and French negotiators met with Hitler in Munich and agreed with him that the Sudetenland should be ceded to Germany immediately. Returning to London from the Munich Conference, Chamberlain told cheering crowds that he had secured “peace with honour . . . peace for our time.”
25 Sold out by the Western powers, Czechoslovakia gave in.

Hitler Playing with All the Statesmen This satirical cartoon from 1938 shows Hitler playing with all the statesmen attending the Four Power (Italy, Germany, England, France) Peace Conference that year in Munich. The Munich Agreement that came out of this meeting permitted Germany to annex the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, although representatives of that country were not invited to the conference. British prime minister Neville Chamberlain is portrayed in the lower right corner, under Hitler’s boot.
Hitler’s armies occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia, however, in March 1939. This time, there was no possible rationale of selfdetermination for Nazi aggression. When Hitler used the question of German minorities in Danzig as a pretext to confront Poland, Chamberlain declared that Britain and France would fight if Hitler attacked his eastern neighbor. Hitler did not take these warnings seriously and pressed on.
Through the 1930s Hitler had constantly referred to ethnic Slavs in the Soviet Union and other countries as Untermenschen (OON-ter-men-schen) (inferior people), and relations between the two countries had grown increasingly tense. War between Germany and the Soviet Union seemed inevitable, and, indeed, Stalin believed that Great Britain and France secretly hoped the Nazis and Bolsheviks would destroy each other. Then, in an about-face that stunned the world, sworn enemies Hitler and Stalin signed a nonaggression pact in August 1939. Each dictator promised to remain neutral if the other became involved in war. An attached secret protocol divided eastern Europe into German and Soviet zones “in the event of a political and territorial reorganization.”
26 Stalin agreed to the
1918
pact for three reasons: he distrusted Western intentions, he needed more time to build up Soviet industry and military reserves, and Hitler offered territorial gain.
For Hitler, everything was now set. He told his generals on the day of the nonaggression pact, “My only fear is that at the last moment some dirty dog will come up with a mediation plan.”
27 On September 1, 1939, the Germans attacked Poland from three sides. Two days later, Britain and France, finally true to their word, declared war on Germany. The Second World War in Europe had begun.
