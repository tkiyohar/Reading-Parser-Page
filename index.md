A mobilization known as the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which was directed by Chinese leader Mao Zedong between 1966 and 1976. fter the Second World War, the world faced deep and swift currents of change that swept from the decolonization of Asia and Africa to social revolutions such as those in China and Cuba. These transformations were the outcome of movements that began well before the Second World War and were accelerated by the war’s upheaval. The transformations took place in the international context of the Cold War, a rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. As people in Asia and Africa pushed back against centuries of Western expansion and demanded national self-determination and racial equality, new nations emerged and nearly every colonial territory gained formal independence between 1945 and the early 1960s. A revolution in China consolidated Communist rule and initially followed the Soviet model, but then veered in new directions. Rather than form an allied Communist front, China and the Soviet Union became economic and political rivals. The Cold War that emerged between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. following the world war did not involve armed conflict between the two nations. But it became a global experience in which each country backed rival factions in conflicts around the world. The Cold War also imposed a division between western European countries allied to the United States, and eastern European nations that the Soviet Union brought into its zone of influence.

The rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union divided postwar Europe and became a long, tense standoff, the Cold War. As the Cold War took shape, three events separated by barely two years foreshadowed the changes that would take place in the world following the Second World War: the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947; the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948; and the Communist revolution in China in 1949. All had their roots in the decades preceding the Second World War — and even predating the First World War. Yet each was shaped by the war and its outcomes. Cold War The post–World War II conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Cold War The Cold War originated in disputes over the political outcome of the war. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin insisted that his country needed control of eastern Europe to guarantee military security from Germany. While U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt had been inclined to accommodate these demands, his successor, Harry Truman, demanded free elections throughout eastern Europe. Stalin refused. The United States’ status as the only country that possessed atomic weapons at the end of the war bolstered Truman’s tough stance. Just as the U.S. sense of security came from having a monopoly on the atomic bomb, Stalin pursued security by militarily occupying eastern Europe and imposing compliant governments that would provide a buffer against the threat of western European aggression. These countries were considered Soviet satellites — nations whose politics and economics were modeled on and dictated by the Soviet Union. President Truman misread these occupations as a campaign for world domination. Communist movements in Greece and China, beyond Stalin’s occupation zone, fed these fears. In October 1945 Truman issued the Truman Doctrine, aimed at “containing” communism to areas already occupied by the Soviet army by providing military and economic support to governments threatened by Communist control. (His reference to regimes imposed by force applied only to Europe and countries threatened by communism, not to European colonial domination of Asia and Africa.) Truman Doctrine The 1945 American policy of preventing the spread of Communist rule. Truman asked Congress for military aid for Greece and Turkey to prevent the spread of communism. Soon after, Secretary of State George C. Marshall proposed a broader package of economic and food aid — the Marshall Plan — to help Europe rebuild. Stalin refused Marshall Plan assistance for eastern Europe. The Soviet Union’s support for the overthrow of the democratically elected Czechoslovakian government in 1948 and its replacement by a Communist government shocked the U.S. Congress into approving the Marshall Plan in April 1948. Marshall Plan A 1948 American plan for providing economic aid to Europe to help it rebuild after World War II. A lasting pattern of escalating reactions to real and perceived provocations was established between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Stalin retaliated by blocking road traffic through the Soviet zone of Germany to Berlin, prompting the U.S. and its allies to airlift millions of tons of provisions to the West Berliners. After 324 days the Soviets backed down: containment seemed to work. In 1949 the United States formed an antiSoviet military alliance of Western governments: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Stalin countered by tightening his hold on his satellites, united in 1955 under the Warsaw Pact. Europe was divided into two hostile blocs. British prime minister Winston Churchill warned that an “iron curtain has descended across the Continent.” NATO The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an anti-Soviet military alliance of Western nations, formed in 1949. Berlin Airlift Residents of Berlin watch a U.S. Air Force cargo plane land with supplies to support West Berliners during the Soviet blockade (1948–1949). The Soviet Union, with its massive army arrayed across eastern Europe, and the United States, with its industrial strength and atomic weapons, emerged as superpowers whose might dwarfed that of other countries. Superpower status reached an awkward balance after the Soviet Union developed its own atomic weapons in 1949. Both nations pitched themselves into a military and geopolitical confrontation that stopped short of outright war: the Cold War (Map 31.1). MAP 31.1 Cold War Europe in the 1950s Europe was divided by an “iron curtain” during the Cold War. None of the Communist countries of eastern Europe were participants in the Marshall Plan. An ideological divide defined the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States saw itself as the defender of a “free world” governed by liberal principles such as free markets, private property, and individual rights protected by democratic constitutions. The Soviet Union defined itself as the defender of the rights of workers and peasants against their exploiters, the rights of colonial peoples against their colonizers, and economic development based on planning and equitable distribution. The Cold War sharpened the distinctions between these models, creating opposing paths that the superpowers pressured other countries to follow.

THE 20TH CENTURY IS THE AMERICAN CENTURY

Some facts about our time

Consider the Soch Century. It is not only the sense that we happen to live there but ours also because it is America's first century as a dominant power in the world. So far, this century of ours has been a profound and tragic disappointment. No other century has been so big with promise for human progress and happiness. And in no one century have so many men and women and children suffered such pain and anguish and bitter death.

It is a baffling and difficult and paradoxical century. No doubt all centuries were paradoxical to those who had to cope with them. But, like everything else, our paradoxes today are bigger and better than ever. Yes, better as well as bigger-inherently better. We have poverty and starvation -but only in the midst of plenty. We have the biggest wars in the midst of the most widespread, the deepest and the most articulate hatred of all history. We have tyrannies and dictatorships-but only when democratic idealism, once regarded as the dubious eccentricity of a colonial nation, is the faith of a huge majority of the people of the world.

And ours is also a revolutionary century. The paradoxes make it inevitably In science and Revolutionary, e of course, And also revolutionary, as a corollary in politics and of society. But to that a revolution is in structure not to say that the men with no progress are either the craziest ideas or the angriest Ideat or the most plausible ideas are going to come out on top. The Revolution 1776 was won and established by men most of whom spoke to have been both gentlemen and men of common sense. Clearly a revolutionary epoch signifies great changes, adjustments. And this is only one reason why it is really so

foolish for people to worry about our "constitutional democ

racy" without worrying or, bewer, thinking hard about the

world revolution. For only as we go out to meet and solve for our time the problems of the world revolution, can we know how to re-establish our constitutional democracy for another 10 or 100 years.

This 20th Century is baffling, difficult, paradoxical, revolutionary but by now, at the cost of much pain and many hopes deferred, we know a good deal about it. And we ought to accommodate our outlook to this knowledge so dearly bought. For example, say tres conception of our world of the 20th Century must surely include a vivid awareness of at least these four propositions,

First: our world of 1,000,000,000 human beings is for the first time in history one world, fundamentally indivisible. Second: modera man hates war and feels intuitively that, in its present scale and frequency, it may even be fatal to his species. Third: our world, again for the first time in human history, is capable of producing all the material needs of the entire human family. Fourth: the world of the 20th Century, if it is to come to life in any nobility of health and vigor, must be to a significant degree an American Century.

As to the first and second: in postulating the indivisibility of the contemporary world, one does not necessarily imagine that anything like a world state-a parliament of men-muse be brought about in this century. Nor need we assume that war can be abolished. All that it is necessary to feel-and to feel deeply-is that terrific forces of magnetic attraction and repulsion will operate as between every large group of human beings on this planet. Large sections of the human family may be effectively organized into opposition to each other. Tyrannies may require a large amount of living space. But Freedom requires and will require far greater living space. than Tyranny. Peace cannot endure unless it prevails over a very large part of the world. Justice will come near to losing all meaning in the minds of men unless Justice can have approximately the same fundamental meanings in many lands and among many peoples. As to the third point-the promise of adequate production for all mankind, the "more abundant life"-be it noted that this is characteristically an American promise. It is a promise easily made, here and elsewhere, by demagogues and proponents of all manner of alick schemes and "planned econora-, ies." What we must insist on is that the abundant life is predicated on Freedom-on the Freedom which has created less possibility-on a vision of Freedom under Law. Without Freedora, there will be no abundant life. With Freedom, there can be.

And finally there is the belief-shared let us remember by most men living-that the 20th Century must be to a significant degree an American Century. This knowledge calls us to action now.

AMERICA'S VISION OF OUR WORLD

... How it shall be created

What can we say and foresce about an American Century? It is meaningless merely to say that we reject isolationism and accept the logic of internationalism. What international alisma Rome had great internationalism. So had the Vatican and Genghis Khan and the Ottoman Turks and the Chinese Emperors and 19ch ( World War, Lenin had one Henry England. After the first in mind. Today Hitler seems to have one in mind-one which appeals strongly to some AmerIcan-isolationists whose opinion of Europe is so low that they would gladly hand it over to anyone who would guarantee to destroy it forever. But what internationalism have we Americans to offert

be Ours cannot come out of the vision of any one man. It must be the product of the imaginations of many mea. It must be shared with all peoples of our Bill of Rights, our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, our magnificent industrial products, and our technical skills. It must be an International Jam of the people, by the people sod for the people. In general, the issues which the American people champion revolve around their determination to make the society of men safe for the freedom, growth and increasing satisfaction of all individual men. Beside that resolve, the answers, groans, catcalls, cecch-grinding, hisses and roars of the Narl Prop agenda Ministry are of small moment.

Once we cease to distract ourselves with lifeless arguments about isolationism, we shall be amazed to discover that there is already an immense American Internationalism. American jazz, Hollywood movies, American slang, American machines and patented products, are in fact the only things that every community in the world, from Zanzibar to Hamborg, recognises in common. Blindly, unintentionally, accidentally and really in spite of ourselves, we are already a world power in all the trivial ways-in very human ways. But there is a great deal more than that. America is already the intellectual, scientific and artistic capital of the world. Americans-Midwestern Americant-are today the least provincial people in the world. They have traveled the most and they know more about the world than the people of any other country. America's worldwide experience in commerce is also far greater than most of us realize.

Most important of all, we have that indefinable, unmistakable sign of leadership: prestige. And unlike the prestige of Rome or Genghis Khan or 19th Century England, American prestige throughout the world is faith in the good intentions as well as in the ultimate intelligence and ultimate strength of the whole American people. We have lost some of that prestige in the last few years. But most of it is still there,

No narrow definition can be given to the American internationalism of the 20th Century. It will také shape, as all civilizations take shape, by the living of it, by work and effort, by trial and error, by enterprise and adventure and experience.

And by imagination! As America enters the world scene, we need most of all to seek and to bring forth a vision of America & world power which is authentically American and which can inspire us to live and work and fight with vigor and enthusiasm. And as we come now to the great test, it yet turn out that in all our trials and tribulations of spirit I may during the first part of this century we as a people have been painfully apprehending the meaning of our time and now in this moment of testing there may come clear at last the vision which will guide us to the authentic creation of the Loch Century-our Century.

Consider four areas of life and thought in which we may

Hock to realize such a vision: Pirst, the economy. It is for America and for America alone to determine whether a system of free economic enterprise-an economic order compatible with freedom and rass-shell. 1. or shall not prevail in this century. We know perfectly well that there is not the slightest chance of any. thing falodly resembling a free economic system prevailing in this country if it prevails nowhere else. What then does Aperice have to decide? Some few deck plans are quite simple, For example we have to decide whether or not we shall have for ourselves and our friends freedom of the seas-the right and our ocean-going airplanes where we to go with our ships and as we wish. The vision of America as the principal guarantor of the freedom of the seas, the visions of Americas as the dynamic leader of world trade, I have within it the Amorous human progress possibilities of soch ano as to stagger the Imagination. Let's not be staggered by it. Let us rise to the tremendous possibilities. Our thinking of world trade today is on ridiculously small terms. For example, we think of Asis as being worth only a few hundred millions a year to us. Actually, in the decades to come Asia

will be worth to us exactly zero-or else it will be worth four, five, ten billions of dollars a year. And the latter are the terme ve mest think of, or else confess a pitiful impotence.

Closely akin to the purely economic area and yet quite different from it, there is the picture of an America which will send out through the world its technical and artistic skills. Engineers, scientists, doctors, movie men, makers of entertainment, developers of airlines, builders of roads, teachers, educators. Throughout the world, these skills, this training. This leadership is needed and will be eagerly welcomed, if only we have the imagination to see it and the sincerity and good will to create the world of the 20th Century.

But now there is a third thing which our vision must immediately be concerned with. We must undertake now to be the Good Samaritan of the entire world. It is the manifest dury of this country to undertake to feed all the people of the world who as a result of this worldwide collapse of civilization. tion are hungry and destitute-all of them, that is, where we can from time to time reach consistently with a very tough attitude toward all hostile governments. For every dollar we spend on armaments, we should spend at least a dime in a gigantic effort to feed the world-and all the world should know that we have dedicated ourselves to this task. Every farmer in America should be encouraged to produce all the crops he can, and all that we cannot eat-and perhaps some of us could eat less-should forthwich be dispatched to the four quarters of the globe as a free gift, administered by a humanitarian army of Americans, to every man, woman and child on this earth who is really hungry.

But all this is not enough. All this will fail and none of it

will happen unless our vision of America as a world power includes a passionate devotion to great American ideals. We have some things in this country which are infinitely precious and especially American-a love of freedom, a feeling for the equality of opportunity, a tradition of self-reliance and low dependence and also of co-operation. In addition to ideals and notions which are especially American, we are the inheritors of all the great principles of Wessera civilization above all Justice, the love of Truth, the ideal of Charity. The other day Herbert Hoover said that America was fast becoming the sanctuary of the ideals of civilization. For the moment it may be enough to be the sanctuary of these ideals. But not for long. It now becomes our time to be the powerhouse from which the ideals spread throughout the world and do their mysterious work of lifting the life of mankind from the level of the beasts to what the Psalmist called a little lower than the angels.

America the dynamic center of ever-widening spheres of enterprise, America as the training center of the skillful servants of mankind, America as the Good Samaritan, really. believing again that it is more blessed to give than to receives and America as the powerhouse of the ideals of Freedom and Justice-out of these elements surely can be fashlooed a vision of oth Century to which we can and will devocs dur the 10th selves in joy and gladocsa and vigor and enthusiasm

Other nations can survive simply because they have endured so long-sometimes with more and sometimes with less significance. But this nation, conceived la adventure and dedicated to the progress of man-the station cannot truly endure unless there courses strongly through its veins from Maine to California the blood purposes and enterprise and

high resolve.. Throughout the 17th Century and the 19th Century and the 19th this continent teemed with manifold port and es purposes. Above them all and wearing them all together into the most exciting flag of all the world and of all history was the triumphal purpose of freedom.

It is in this spirit that all of us are called, each to his own

measure of capacity, and each in the widest horison of his

vision, to create the first great American Century.

Modern History Sourcebook: Winston S. Churchill:

Winston S. Churchill, excerpts from "The Iron Curtain Speech," 1946. © in the public domain.

"Iron Curtain Speech", March 5, 1946

Winston Churchill gave this speech at Westminster College, in Fulton, Missouri, after receiving an honorary degree. With typical oratorical skills, Church introduced the phrase "Iron Curtain" to describe the division between Western powers and the area controlled by the Soviet Union. As such the speech marks the onset of the Cold War.

The speech was very long, and here excerpts are presented.

The United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment for American democracy. For with this primacy in power is also joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future. As you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty done, but also you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the level of achievement. Opportunity is here now, clear and shining, for both our countries. To reject it or ignore it or fritter it away will bring upon us all the long reproaches of the aftertime.

It is necessary that constancy of mind, persistence of purpose, and the grand simplicity of decision shall rule and guide the conduct of the English-speaking peoples in peace as they did in war. We must, and I believe we shall,

prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement.

I have a strong admiration and regard for the valiant Russian people and for my wartime comrade, Marshal Stalin. There is deep sympathy and goodwill in Britain -- and I doubt not here also toward the peoples of all the Russias and a resolve to persevere through many differences and rebuff in establishing lasting friendships.

It is my duty, however, to place before you certain facts about the present position in Europe.

From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient.

states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in

one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow. The safety of the world, ladies and gentlemen, requires a unity in Europe, from which no nation should be permanently outcast. It is from the quarrels of the strong parent races in Europe that the world wars we have witnessed, or which occurred in former times, have sprung.

Twice the United States has had to send several millions of its young men across the Atlantic to fight the wars. But now we all can find any nation, wherever it may dwell, between dusk and dawn. Surely we should work with conscious

purpose for a grand pacification of Europe within the structure of the United Nations and in accordance with our Charter.

In a great number of countries, far from the Russian frontiers and throughout the world,

Communist fifth columns are established and work in complete unity and absolute obedience to the directions they receive from the Communist center. Except in the British Commonwealth and in the United States where Communism is in its infancy, the Communist parties or fifth columns constitute a growing challenge and peril to Christian civilization.

The outlook is also anxious in the Far East and especially in Manchuria. The agreement which was made at Yalta, to which I was a party, was extremely favorable to Soviet Russia, but it was made at a time when no one could say that the

The German war might not extend all through the summer and autumn of 1945 and when the Japanese war was expected by the best judges to last for a further eighteen months from the end of the German war.

I repulse the idea that a new war is inevitable -- still more that it is imminent. It is because I am sure that our fortunes are still in our own hands and that we hold the power to save the future, that I feel the duty to speak out now that I have the occasion and the opportunity to do so.

I do not believe that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.

But what we have to consider here today while time remains, is the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries. Our difficulties and dangers will not be removed by closing our eyes to them. They will not be removed by mere waiting to see what happens; nor will they be removed by a policy of appeasement.

What is needed is a settlement, and the longer this is delayed, the more difficult it will be and the greater our dangers will become.

From what I have seen of our Russian friends and allies during the war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for weakness, especially military weakness.

For that reason the old doctrine of a balance of power is unsound. We cannot afford, if we can help it, to work on narrow margins, offering temptations to a trial of strength.

Last time I saw it all coming and I cried aloud to my own fellow countrymen and to the world, but no one paid any attention. Up till the year 1933 or even 1935, Germany might have been saved from the awful fate which has overtaken her and we might all have been spared the miseries Hitler let loose upon mankind.

There never was a war in history easier to prevent by timely action than the one which has just desolated such great areas of the globe. It could have been prevented, in my belief, without the firing of a single shot, and Germany might be powerful, prosperous and honored today; but no one would listen and one by one we were all sucked into the awful whirlpool.

We must not let it happen again. This can only be achieved by reaching now, in 1946, a good understanding on all points with Russia under the general authority of the United Nations Organization and by the maintenance of that good understanding through many peaceful years, by the whole strength of the English-speaking world and all its connections.

If the population of the English-speaking Commonwealth be added to that of the United States, with all that such cooperation implies in the air, on the sea, all over the globe, and in science and in industry, and in moral force, there will be no quivering, precarious balance of power to offer its temptation to ambition or adventure. On the contrary there will be an overwhelming assurance of security.

If we adhere faithfully to the Charter of the United Nations and walk forward in sedate and sober strength, seeking no one's land or treasure, seeking to lay no arbitrary control upon the thoughts of men, if all British moral and material forces and convictions are joined with your own in fraternal association, the high roads of the future will be clear, not only for us but for all, not only for our time but for a century to come.

America's Berlin

Heart of the Cold War

Ernest R. May

For the United States, the high Cold War commenced with the blockade imposed on Berlin by the Red Army and, in response, the American and British airlift of supplies in 1948-49. Ordinary Americans then began to think major war was a real possibility. That phase of the Cold War came to its climax in 1961-62 with the sudden building of the Berlin Wall and a gunbarrel-to- gunbarrel face-off between American and Soviet tanks at an undistinguished urban intersection known as Checkpoint Charlie; then, most terrifying of all, came a crisis ostensibly about Soviet missiles in Cuba but at least equally about Berlin.

Détente was reached at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s when the American and Soviet governments and those of the two Germanies accepted the division of Germany and of Berlin as facts to be lived with. The Cold War passed into history when the Wall came down in 1989 and Berlin once again became a united city. For Americans, the Cold War always had Berlin at its center. Without the continuing commitment to West Berlin, their experience of those decades could have been different, possibly better, but possibly much, much worse.

ANATOMY OF A DIVISION

At the end of World War II, Americans were determined to dictate the peace from Berlin, capital of the despised adversary. They believed it had been a mistake not to have done so in World War I. This belief contributed to U.S. insistence on unconditional surrender by the Nazi regime. It also contributed to wartime Agreements regarding postwar occupation zones of defeated Germany. Because the zones' boundaries were drawn on the basis of estimates of where Western and Soviet armies would meet up, the prospective Soviet zone included Berlin and much surrounding territory. The inter-Allied agreements provided nonetheless that the United States, Britain, and France would each be responsible for one of four sectors in Berlin. All the victorious nations could thus presume to be present

America's Berlin

in the enemy capital when terms for the future of Germany were laid down.

The final summit conference of the war took place in the summer of 1945 at Potsdam, on the outskirts of Berlin. Bombing had rendered the city almost unrecognizable. Much given to thinking of the present by analogy with the past, President Harry Truman likened Berlin to Carthage. In July 1945 he presided when an American flag was raised over the U.S. headquarters building in Berlin. He would surely have been startled to be told that

such a flag would fly until September 1994. when the Four Power military occupation of the city formally ended.

In a breathtakingly short time, the United States evolved from a conqueror of Berlin to the city's protector. Something similar occurred in the relationship with West Germany. American occupation authorities became committed to the economic recovery and political rehabili- tation of both Berlin and Germany. In part, this was because the passions of war quickly burned out. Suffering among the German people aroused the compassion of American soldiers and relief workers. As Germans acquired faces and ceased to be simply the enemy, it became easy for Americans to believe that war crimes trials would rid Germany of its devils. In part, of course, po shifted because of the developing rivalry with the Soviet Union. Americans in Germany and in Washington became keen that Western- occupied territory not slip behind what Winston Churchill famously termed the "iron curtain." Knowing something of the brutal despoliation in Soviet occupation zones, American and British authorities hoped to set a different example in theirs. The twin motives of holding off the Soviets and providing concrete evidence of differences in values worked especially strongly in Berlin, where the Soviet and Western approaches were on daily display.

THE FIRST TEST

The 1948-49 blockade tested America's commitment to West Berlin. The vulnerability of Berlin-located some 100 miles inside the Soviet zone was obvious on any map. Military planners had studied for some time the possibility of an outright Soviet seizure of the city. That the United States and Britain had demobilized nearly all wartime forces sat heavily on their minds. The counterparts of Willie and Joe, the stubbled GIs of Bill Mauldin's classic newspaper cartoons, had long since gone home. The U.S. troops in Germany and Berlin were mostly green recruits with no combat experience and little combat training. The entire U.S. Army strategic reserve consisted of two and one-third divisions. Given intelligence estimates that the Red Army had 175 divisions with forward units still in fighting trim, U.S. planners warned that the Western position in Berlin was militarily untenable. General Omar Bradley, the army chief of staff, suggested withdrawing U.S. forces from Berlin before the Soviets put on a squeeze. This, argued, was preferable to being forced out under pressure, as it would "minimize loss of prestige." Truman and his secretary of state, George Marshall, rejected that advice. Instead, they pursued efforts to bolster the economies of West Germany and West Berlin, to bind the two more tightly, to the West, and to make more manifest the contrast between conditions in the West and in the East. Despite repeated and increasingly emphatic Soviet protests, accompanied by measures designed as reminders that the Red Army controlled West Berlin's lifelines, the three Western powers announced reforms in June 1948 that joined their occupation zones in Germany and Berlin as an economic unit and, through the introduction of a new currency, blocked the Soviets from contin- uing to extract reparations from Western zones as well as their own.

Within days the Soviets responded with their blockade, a complete cutoff of road and rail traffic into West Berlin. Here was the crucial moment of the early Cold War. Pentagon officials reiterated Truman's judgment that Berlin could not be defended. Admiral William D. Leahy, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, inclined to Bradley's view. He wrote in his diary: "The American military position in Berlin is hopeless... It would be advantageous to the United States prospects to withdraw from Berlin." But General Lucius D. Clay, American military governor of Germany and commander of U.S. occupation forces in Europe, called instead for open defiance. He recommended a 200-truck convoy escorted by tanks and infantry. "It is our view," wrote Clay of the Soviets, "that they are bluffing and that their hand can and should be called now."

Truman and Marshall were not of Bradley's and Leahy's mind. Truman said to his advisers, "We're staying. Period." At the same time, he and Marshall re- jected Clay's drastic recommendation. They also rejected a third option that

of retracting the currency reform and re- turning to the bargaining table. Marshall described U.S. policy as "firm" but "unpro- vocative." He announced that the United States and other Western Powers would to the extent of their capacity supply Berlin by airlift The U.S. The Air Force and Britain's Royal Air Force, however, estimated that available airlift could meet only a fraction of West Berlin's needs for supplies and fuel. If the Soviets did not relent soon, it appeared, the Americans and their allies would have to evacuate the city, try an how? armed probe such as Clay had earlier pro

posed, or back down on currency reform. West Berliners' defiance of the Soviets was making any form of retreat increasingly unattractive. In addition to imposing the blockade, the Soviet commander cut off electricity to western sectors of the city and demanded that Berliners refuse to use the new currency. The Berlin City Assembly, meeting in the Soviet sector and surrounded by Stalin's troops, rejected the order. Some 80,000 Berliners rallied the next day to applaud the assembly's action. Soviet authorities offered full rations to West Berliners who would register as their supporters; only a handful signed up. When the Soviets then interfered with the City Assembly and other noncommunist organizations, an estimated quarter of a million Berliners demonstrated in Reichstag Square. Appropriately, since Social Democrats were the strongest political group in West Berlin, it was the British Labor government's foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, who spoke for the Western alliance. Bevin declared: "We cannot abandon those stouthearted Berlin democrats who

are refusing to bow to Soviet pressure." Meanwhile, the American and British air forces uncovered new airlift capabilities. Transport and cargo planes from the war came out of mothballs. Showing the 4

determination and managerial skill that would before long make the U.S. Strategic Air Command one of the most efficient military forces in history, General Curtis LeMay organized round-the-clock flights into and out of Berlin. At the airlift's peak, U.S. C-54s and British Dakotas landed and took off from Tempe Lds Tegel, and Gatow airports once a minute on average, 24 hours a day, unloading daily the equivalent of the cargo of two dozen normal freight trains. The airlift kept West Berlin well supplied for many months until Stalin signaled will- ingness to call off the blockade and finally did so in September 1949. Together, the prudent resoluteness of Western govern- ments, the courage and unity of West Berliners, and the logistical success of the airlift prevented the disappearance of West Berlin into the Soviet sphere. The blockade and airlift catalyzed an American-European military alliance. True, the Brussels Pact of March 1948 had already united Western Europe for defense against the Soviets, and almost everyone anticipated some American backup guarantee, though not necessarily in the form of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty. True, too, the continuing Soviet military build-up, the Korean conflict of 1950-53, and the consequent militarization of the United States and of U.S. foreign policy accounted for the configuration of NATO as it eventually emerged. Nonethe- less, it was the successful defense of West Berlin in 1948-49 that made the security interests of the United States and those of Western Europe effectively inseparable, at least while the Soviet Union remained powerful and hostile.

The outcome of the first Berlin crisis locked the United States into maintaining an apparently permanent garrison in the most exposed sector of the European continent. So long as this was the case, there could be no question that if an East-West conflict broke out in Europe, the United States would be fully engaged from the very first moment. Until the end of the Cold War, the U.S. commitment to defend West Berlin would differ in no material way from the commitment to defend New York or Los Angeles.

ALTERNATIVE ENDINGS

Given the tendency among scholars to write of the Cold War as if its course and outcome were predetermined and should have been predictable, it is worth pausing for a moment to note how easily this. The first Berlin crisis could have had a different history. Individuals were important. If Trump had been a more timid man-one more like Jimmy Byrnes, his secretary of state before Marshall, or Adlai Stevenson, his chosen and defeated successor he might have reasoned as Bradley and Leahy did. Had he not heard the cautious counsel of Marshall, Under Secretary of State Rober Lovett, and George Kennan of the State Department Policy Planning Staff, he might have acted belligerently, as Clay recommended. Marshall's and Kennan's successors, Dean Acheson and Paul Nitze. would probably have encouraged him to do so. And without the organizing genius of LeMay, Truman would probably have had to choose an alternative policy, for the airlift would not have kept West Berlin alive through the winter.

Important in retrospect is the paradox that Western strength grew from military weakness. A U.S. commander warned that his garrison in Berlin could be overrun "before you could say 'Politburo."" A British general, so it was said at the time, was asked what the Russians would need to reach the Pyrenees and the Atlantic; he replied, "Shoes." This state of affairs lent force to the argument made in all Western capitals that West Germany was just about as inde- fensible as West Berlin. That was Clay's stated reason for dismissing the notion of preemptive withdrawal. "After Berlin will come Western Germany," he wrote, "and our strength there is relatively no greater and our position no more tenable than Berlin." If the boundary of West Germany had been thought more defensible, the proposal to pull the Berlin garrison back to that line might have had more appeal. Finally, it is surely significant that the Soviet Union had not yet successfully tested a nuclear device. Truman's resoluteness during the crisis and that of the British government as well owed something to faith in America's strategic superiority over the U.S.S.R. and to a presumption that fear of bombing, especially atomic bombing, would deter Stalin from letting matters get out of hand. Clay based his recom- mendation for an armed convoy in part on this argument. "They are definitely afraid of our air might," he declared. If either Soviet disinformation or misjudgment by Western intelligence services had given rise to belief that the Soviets already had nuclear weapons, political leaders in Washington and London, and perhaps in West Germany and West Berlin, could well have seen the issues differently. THE CHANGING STRATEGIC PICTURE

When Berlin next became a zone of acute crisis, in 1958-62, conditions had changed. Militarily, Berlin was still isolated and vulnerable. It was now, however, not just inside a Soviet occupation zone; it was an enclave within a German Democratic Republic which, though clearly under Soviet domination, had a government of its own with reasons of its own for wanting to take over West Berlin. Since East Berlin was the GDR's capital, the fact the city was partly noncommunist was symbolically offensive. On practical grounds, West Berlin was dangerous to the GDR because it was a showcase for the material goods that socialism seemed incapable of producing, and, worse yet, offered an easy escape route from East to West for, among others, the skilled and educated workers whom the GDR most needed if it were to compete economically with West Germany. Soviet forces stationed in the GDR and surrounding areas still possessed the power to snuff out West Berlin's independence in days, if not hours. The new local conditions posed an additional threat: if GDR police units were to take over functions from the Red Army, the fact of their doing so would challenge the legitimacy of the continuing presence in Berlin of Western military forces. If East Germans rather than Soviets were to examine papers at one of the city's internal checkpoints, they could easily go on to claim within West Berlin other powers that they exercised in East Berlin, for they would not be under the Four Power accords of 1945 that technically governed and limited Soviet activities.

By 1958, the calculus of comparative strategic vulnerabilities had shifted. In the earlier period, the United States and Britain had been woefully weak on the ground but arguably were less vulnerable than the Soviets should war actually come. In addition to atomic bombs, they had had large mobilizable reserves of conventional bombers. The Soviets had had few that could reach Britain or pene- trate the defenses of a revivified Fighter Command, and had no evident capacity for direct attack on the United States. A decade later, American strategic air power had expanded immensely. LeMay's Strategic Air Command had deployed medium-range B-47s at bases around the globe and new intercontinental-range B-52s based in the United States. All these planes were armed with nuclear or thermonuclear weapons with many times the explosive power of the original atomic bombs. There was little doubt that SAC could do what an Air Force general had described in the early 1950s as the objective of its targeting: reduce the Soviet Union to "a smoking, radiating ruin at the end of two hours." And Britain had its own nuclear weapons and aircraft easily able to reach the Soviet homeland.

Neither Britain nor the United States, however, retained its earlier ability to weather a war. The Soviets had multiplied their own stocks of nuclear and thermo- nuclear weapons. By the late 1950s they had a large fleet of bombers that could reach the British Isles and some that could make one-way flights to North America. Moreover, like the Western powers, the Soviets had invested increasing resources in developing nuclear armed rockets able to reach distant targets at vir- tually the speed of a bullet. In late 1957, by putting the Sputnik satellites in orbit, the Soviet Union demonstrated its ability to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. The United States seemed on the verge of being as totally vulnerable as Britain and the Soviet Union.

Yet another difference between 1948- 49 and 1958-62 was the life of Western

Europe. In the earlier period Western European leaders had been in dread not only of the Red Army but of possible communist inroads in their own countries helped by popular belief that the Soviets were irresistible and might as well be accommodated. The leaders had been desperate for American economic aid and political support, and beyond that, for overt evidence of American military backing.

By the end of the 1950s, Europe had achieved both economic recovery and comparative political stability. Although communist parties remained important, particularly in France and Italy, the chances of their turning a Western country into a Soviet satellite seemed nowhere serious. West Germany had become an independent nation. It was beginning to outstrip other states in Europe economically and was increasingly pursuing an independent foreign policy. Its exercise of sovereignty, however, still confronted the potential threat of the GDR taking over Soviet functions in Berlin, a technical challenge that became doubly complicated as the West German government, sensitive to the many East German refugees in the electorate, rigidly opposed any Western dealings with the GDR that might even hint at recognition.

Western Europe's military dependence on the United States continued. In the early 1950s the United States had posted combat divisions in West Germany. They had been committed at a time of greatly increased overall U.S. military preparedness and when the Soviet-sponsored North Korean attack on South Korea was widely viewed as a rehearsal for a comparable effort in Europe. West German military units, as originally envisioned, would have been replacements for these U.S. divisions. But when such units actually came into being, they served more as adjuncts for U.S. forces presumed to be on permanent station. When rumors cir- culated, as in mid-1956, that the United States might withdraw its troops, Europeans reacted with high alarm.

Given the growing nuclear arsenals on both sides, however, Europeans were at the same time fearful that the United States might either trigger a nuclear war that would engulf their continent or, to save its homeland, abandon them in a crisis. Fear that the United States might do either too much or too little became lacute after the 1956 Suez crisis. For America then to oppose Britain and France (and Israel) seemed to show that the United States could see its interests as at odds with those of its allies. Increased American-Soviet competition in Asia and elsewhere reinforced this perception and also roused concern that Europe could become a victim of a crisis originating elsewhere. In August and September 1958, for example, the United States seemed to threaten nuclear war against the Soviet Union's ally China to deter Chinese occupation of some barren islands off China's own coast.

RAISING THE WALL

In November 1958 Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev set off the new series of Berlin crisis by demanding that a peace treaty for Germany be signed within six months and threatening otherwise to sign a treaty of his own with the GDR, one effect of which would be to transfer to the East German state all Soviet rights and functions in Berlin. He let the dead- line lapse without acting. In 1959, when he visited the United States, he spoke again of the urgent need to change the status of Berlin. This was to be a topic at a Paris summit meeting in May 1960, but Khrushchey walked out of that meeting to protest American U-2 reconnaissance flights over the Soviet Union. He then announced that after the 1960 U.S. presidential election he would insist the new president come to terms over Berlin. When he met John F. Kennedy in Vienna in June 1961 he declared coolly that he was prepared to fight a nuclear war rather than leave Berlin in status quo.

Sources now accessible in the former Soviet Union reveal that Khrushchev was under pressure from the government of the GDR, which was suffering an exodus of refugees that swelled almost by the day. These sources also show that, in view of the widening split with China, Khrushchev was deeply concerned about seeming unwilling to stand up to the Americans. An important new element was Fidel Castro's success in Cuba; Khrushchev was desperately afraid of a

Cuban tilt toward the Chinese In August 1961 Soviet and GDR forces

suddenly put up the Berlin Wall. Concrete blocks and bricks were deployed overnight, then the hideous structure rose in stages-fence posts and coils of barbed wire, then a high cement-block wall; behind that, a second wall with a deep trench and dog runs; the whole surveyed by watchtowers with search lights and machine guns like those in a penitentiary. President Kennedy had already been careful to make clear that the United States did not claim any control over the Soviet sector of Berlin. He had said that the United States was committed to defend "the frontier of freedom," but he had spoken of that frontier as including only West Berlin. For theatrical effect, Kennedy sent General Clay back to the city. American soldiers conducted maneu- vers in which they tore down replicas of parts of the Wall. At this juncture the American and the Soviet tanks confronted each other at Checkpoint Charlie. Nothing happened. Kennedy and Khrushchev communicate privately, Soviet tanks turned around, and American tanks did likewise.

Some analysts at the time and long after, concluded that the building of the Wall had ended the protracted Berlin crisis in Moscow's favor. In fact, the Wall solved few of the problems Khrushchev and his East German allies faced, and made other problems worse. While the Wall prevented more people from leaving for the West and shuttered the Berlin showcase of Western capitalism, it served as an open confession that the GDR could hold its population only behind a prison barricade. For leaders in the GDR, the Wall was no substitute for control of the entire capital. And for Khrushchev, the building of the Wall did little, for he had not achieved the long-sought Berlin settlement, and he had gained nothing in his struggle with the Chinese for predominance within the world communist movement.

In the winter of 1961-62 the Pentagon intensively conjured up scenarios for dealing with a Soviet or an East German move against West Berlin. All these scenarios involved at least heightening the threat of nuclear war. Some called for demonstration nuclear strikes on relatively unpopulated targets in the Soviet sphere. At the Soviet Party Congress of October 1961 Khrushchev declared that he would sign his own German peace treaty by the end of the year. Once again he let his deadline pass, but in a personal letter to Kennedy he wrote imploringly, "You have to understand, I have no ground to retreat further, there is a precipice behind." After continuing to make threats throughout the spring and summer of 1962, Khrushchev informed Kennedy that he would wait until after the November congressional elections and then "give him a choice to go to war or sign a peace treaty." Returning from a visit to Europe, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara said publicly that conditions in Berlin were as tense as at any time since the Korean conflict. CUBAN MISSILES

In October 1962 Kennedy discovered that Khrushchev was speedily and secretly setting up strategic missile launchers in Cuba. Though some historians have been inclined to accept Khrushchev's post hoc justification that he acted primarily to help defend Cuba against a possible U.S. invasion, chances are that his explanation arose from the fact that all he got from the resultant crisis was a renewed but still conditional U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba. At the time he decided to turn Cuba into a missile base, Berlin was the dominant foreign policy issue in Moscow. Anatoly Dobrynin, who was just leaving to become Soviet ambassador in Washington, recalls that "Germany

and Berlin overshadowed everything." Intertwined with the Berlin issue were new questions about the strategic balance. In October 1961 a Pentagon spokesman had said quietly but publicly that the alleged "missile gap" was nonexistent. Satellite photography proved what U-2

photography had merely suggested that THE IMPOSSIBLE STATUS QUO Khrushchev's claims about turning out ICBMs "like sausages" were largely bluff. This disclosure was not only an embar- rassment for Khrushchev diplomatically, but affected the Soviet position vis-à-vil the Chinese, for one count in Beijing's indictment of Khrushchev had been failure to aggressively develop the communist world's overall capabilities for nuclear war. When Khrushchev's experts told him that placing shorter-range missiles in Cuba would partly remedy the strategic imbalance, it had to be welcome advice. No expert on Cuba suggested that these missiles would make Cuba safer; indeed all the specialists warned that Castro might resist because of fear that they would make Cuba more of a target for the United States. But Khrushchev might well have thought, nonetheless, that the missiles would contribute to Cuba's defense. Trying to sort out his motives is like discerning those of a gambler who bets all he has on a single cast of the dice.

Kennedy interpreted the discovery of missiles in Cuba as the opening of a new Berlin crisis. He found confirmation when Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko visited Washington just before the discovery was made public. The microphones that Kennedy had secretly installed in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room captured on tape his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff the morning after his meeting with Gromyko: "What's basic to them is Berlin-In every conversation we've had with the Russians, that's what- Even last night we talked about Cuba for a while, but Berlin- that's what Khrushchev's committed himself to personally." sign his own German peace treaty by the end of the year. Once again he let his deadline pass, but in a personal letter to Kennedy he wrote imploringly, "You have to understand, I have no ground to retreat further, there is a precipice behind." After continuing to make threats throughout the spring and summer of 1962, Khrushchev informed Kennedy that he would wait until after the November congressional elections and then "give him a choice to go to war or sign a peace Some analysts, at the time and long treaty." Returning from a visit to Europe, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara said publicly that conditions in Berlin were as tense as at any time since the Korean conflict.

The dilemma Kennedy faced during the missile crisis had inherited the American commitment to Berlin ever since 1948-49. There was no conceivable way in which the city could be defended or retaken simply by local use of conventional military force. The only deterrent to a Soviet or East German takeover was a threat of military action elsewhere, almost certainly with air power and eventually, if not immediately, with nuclear weapons. As nuclear arsenals on both sides grew, this increasingly involved a likely if not inevitable escalation to general nuclear war.

The threat to do something militarily in response to Soviet or East German action against West Berlin had been only faintly credible in the period of the U.S. nuclear monopoly. A transfer of B-29s to bases in Britain during the 1948-49 crisis was a bluff by Truman on a par with that of Khrushchev later, for it was evident to the naked eye that these planes and their bases were not equipped to handle the then-boxcar sized atomic bombs. Eisen hower had said privately, considering the possible use of nuclear weapons to defend Berlin, "You might as well go out and shoot everyone you see and then shoot yourself." Nevertheless, he saw no choice but to continue to voice the threat, for the alternative was to concede that the United States could do nothing to prevent two million West Berliners from becoming unwilling subjects of the GDR. A key to U.S. actions during the first half of the Cold War is found in the inability to protect Berlin by any means other than a bizarre proposition: preserving microscopic credibility for an inherently incredible threat.

Before the missile crisis, Kennedy had groped for some alternative. He had said to one of his sidex "It seemailly for us to be facing an atomic war over a treaty preserving Berlin as the fate capital of a reunited Germany when all of us know that Germany will probably never be re united God knows To not an isola- dionist, but it seems particularly stupid to risk killing a million Americans over an argument about access rights." After the crisis, he spoke of Berlin as an impossible situation and pressed his advice to come up with formulas offering some hope of escape. He did not move far along this line before his ansamination in November 1963 The outcome of the missile crisis, fortunately, made it almost impossible for Khrushchev to act adven Tumusly again. His colleagues removed him from office in 1964, bring him of hearing damaged the international prestige of our government, our party, armed forces, while at the same tinie helping to raise the authority of the United States Khrubchev's eventual sor, Levald Betahoes, occasionally protested Berlin's anomalous status but precipitated no new crises

Kennedy had not been the first Ameri- can policymaker to seek some alternative defeat of West Berlin by threat of madear as Kennan had pleaded for such thinking during his last days as head of the Policy Planning Staff in 19ga.

But, he continued, the wound "at be healed with the consent of Eastern European countries and the consent of the Soviet Union''While his words did not imply abandonment of the ideals of national self-determination and individual freedom of choice, they did imply that the United States was prepared to accept the reality of two Germanies, and of the two Germanies assuming primary responsibility for the status and future of Berlin

LET THEM COME TO BERLINI

From 1948 to 1971 a commitment to Berlin had been a crucial factor in US foreign policy. The success of the airlift left the United States for all these years holding the most advanced military out- post in Western Europe. The need to 1post i preserve some degree of credibility for the U.S. pledge to defend West Berlin's population greatly limited Washington's flexibility with regard to any part of the Soviet bloc or, after the block evident fracture, with either the U.S.S.R. or China. That need contributed to the American government's reacting as strongly as it did to, for example, Guatemala's leftward tilt and China's moves to take control of the Quemoy and Matsu islands. It helps account for Eisenhmeer saying to Kennedy during the 1960-ta transition the landlocked, impoverished Laos was a crucial theater East-West competition. It also helps account for the conviction carried over into the Kennedy, Johnson, and Ni administrations that sign of US weakening on South Vietnam could eopandise American credibility around the world. One can argue, in other words, that the success of 1948-49 and the consequent commitment to Berlin created a straitjacket for the United States for the

duration of the high Cold War One can also argue, however, that the commitment to Berlin contributed importantly to the Cold War's becoming what the historian John Lewis Gaddis terms "the long peace." Seeing U.S. tenacity in risking all-out war for such an exposed site may well have had a cooling infants in Moscow and even in Beijing Strategic theorists argue that nuclear

deterrence gains effectiveness if you side thinks the other not entirely rational Such amendment may have figured into the Soviet government's refraining from intervention in Yugoslavia, agreeing to negotiated withdrawal from Austria, and exhibiting great caution in the aggos and 1960s with regard to the Middle East.

Fear of provoking some Soviet move against Berlin certainly made the United States wary about attempting earth in dispute with the supposed Sino-overt action elsewhere, most obviously against Castro's Cuba. After the missile crisis Kennedy's tape recorder caught him musing to one of the chiefs of staff "What we're trying to do is think of something about Berlin-Because Berlin is really paralyzing-Because everything you want to do, you say, "Oh, well it will screw as in Berlin Absent the American commitment to West Berlin, the Cold War might more often have verged on hot war. Unquestionably its course would have been different.

After the scenes of 1971, Berlin nonetheless retained great symbolic power for Americans. The Vietnam War and atrovent demographic and social changes at home had by then created a strong current of doubt that the Cold War was another good way But runs of picture of Berliners cheering the airlift helped keep some of the old faith flickering It was hard for any American eve doctrinaire "revisionist"-to see the Berlin Wall and not come away cocinando that there was some moral different between the Cold War rivals. Visiting Berlin in 1965, Kennedy declared, "People who mally don't understand, or ay they don't, what is the great iut between the free world and the communist world the come to Bedia President Regn visited Berlin in 1987 and looked upon a new Soviet regime ostensibly committed to change. Standing a hundred yards from the venerable Brandenburg Gate of old Berlin, he said: "General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here, to this gate." Then, with the world's television cameras trained on the newer, barbarous barrier dividing the city, Reagan demanded, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."

For most Americans, the end of the Cold War came as their television screens in November 1989 showed the jubilation of Berliners tearing down the Wall. Though historians may identify demon- strations in Leipzig or other events as more critical turning points, the images that endure are those of Berliners wielding their hammers and wire-cutters. The transition to an era yet unnamed is symbolized by photographs of President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl walking arm in arm through the open Brandenburg Gate. In this new era, Berlin is restored as the capital of a united and democratic Germany.

How all this history will be recalled a generation or more from now is hard to foresee. During the Cold War, the United States and Germany were partners. The partnership persists, and Berlin's being the capital may provide reinforcement. Americans may remember Berlin's defiant maintenance of its own independence and freedom, and Germans may have more reason to be reminded of the enduring value of the Cold War relationship with the United States. But books and films also keep vivid for Americans images of Berlin as the city of Hitler, swastika banners, and Stormtrooper jackboots. And Germans, Berliners included, have a very old and very lively tradition of interpreting American actions as selfish and exploitative. For Germany and Berlin to be once again synonymous could cause Americans or Germans or both to be reminded more of differences and past conflicts than of the closeness between the two peoples after the airlift. Events could tip the balance either way, and events will control. But the parts of history people best remember tend to be those that are the subjects of lively writing and well-crafted movies and television programs. Perhaps Americans and Germans interested in continuing partner ship should invest in making the history of Berlin in the Cold War as unforgettable as its history in the Nazi era.
